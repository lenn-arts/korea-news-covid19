The branches include the group's headquarters in Gwacheon, just south of Seoul, and facilities in the cities of Busan, Gwangju and Daejeon.The raid marks the prosecution's first forcible investigation into the group since February when a group of people who claimed to be victims of the religious group filed a complaint against the 89-year-old Lee for embezzlement, dereliction of duty and violation of infectious disease prevention laws.The group is accused of causing the country's biggest cluster outbreaks, accounting for some 47 percent of the country's total caseload of 11,142. Its worship services, where members sit close together and chant loud in poorly ventilated spaces, are believed to have been a factor in the rapid spread the virus. Also, Lee is accused of ordering group members not to fully cooperate with health officials, thus hindering state efforts to contain COVID-19 in the early stages of the pandemic. (Yonhap)"
"2","May 22, 2020","The Korea Herald","OLED TV market may post relatively small growth this year: report","Yonhap","http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200522000392&ACE_SEARCH=1","  The global OLED TV market, led by South Korea's LG Electronics Inc., is expected to post relatively small growth this year, compared with the QLED TV sector, following a disruption in panel supply caused by the novel coronavirus pandemic, a market report showed Friday. The global OLED TV shipment is expected to increase 7.8 percent on-year to 3.375 million units this year, according to display market tracker WitsView, a research division of TrendForce. The figure was a 26.1 percent decrease from its original number forecasted earlier this year. OLED, or organic light-emitting diode, is highlighted by self-illuminating pixels that deliver perfect black, and it is the main display used for LG's high-end TVs.""The OLED TV market faces the dual headwinds of hindered panel supply and high retail prices,"" WitsView said. ""Both market leader LG Electronics and Sony have revised down their shipment targets for OLED TVs this year.""Industry insiders said that production delay from LG Display Co., the sole large-size OLED TV panel supplier in the world, will weigh down the industry. LG Display previously planned to have its OLED panel factory in Guangzhou, China, start mass production in the first quarter of the year, but it could not meet the schedule due to COVID-19 outbreak.The company recently said it plans to fully operate the Guangzhou factory within the first half of the year.  Industry observers said a sharp rise of QLED TVs can further limit OLED TV sales amid the pandemic. ""Aside from the pandemic-induced slowdown in OLED demand, the more flexible pricing of QLED products will also represent a substantial threat to the sales of OLED TVs this year, since the latter have historically maintained a high retail price,"" WitsView said. The global QLED TV shipment is expected to grow 41.8 percent on-year to reach 8.27 million units this year with aggressive sales promotions from the market leader Samsung Electronics Co., according to WitsView.QLED is Samsung's marketing term for its liquid crystal display (LCD) TVs using quantum-dot technology to enhance performance in key picture quality areas. Although overall global TV shipment is expected to suffer 5.8 percent on-year decline to 205.21 million units this year, WitsView said QLED TV sales can increase further.  ""In spite of the downturn in global TV shipment this year, the market for QLED products thrived on the flourishing stay-at-home economy as well as the sales promotions of Samsung Visual Display's older models in the first quarter of 2020, which resulted in retail price cuts of more than 20 percent for 65-inch QLED TVs in the North American market, incidentally creating a wave of replacement demand for new TV sets,"" it said. According to market tracker Omdia, Samsung was the top TV vendor in the January-March period as it accounted for 32.4 percent of the global TV market in terms of sales value. (Yonhap)"

People can use the emergency funds through either credit and debit cards or certificates by end-August.Small merchants' sales almost recovered to last year's level for the first time since the government raised its alert against COVID-19 to the highest level in late February, according to the data.""The emergency relief funds appear to affect consumption. This week, the impact is likely to be larger,"" KCD chief Kim Dong-ho said.An average of their revenues last week surpassed those tallied the previous year in areas such as Gyeonggi Province that surrounds Seoul and South Gyeongsang Province.The southeastern city of Daegu, once the epicenter of the virus outbreak here, and Seoul, meanwhile, saw small merchants' sales almost recover to last year's level, the data showed.The South Korean economy shrank 1.4 percent on-quarter in the first quarter as the coronavirus outbreak dented consumer spending and exports. Private consumption declined 6.4 percent on-quarter in the cited period.South Koreans are using the relief funds at various locations ranging from small supermarkets, restaurants and beauty salons to traditional markets.According to data compiled by three major convenient stores, demand for daily necessities and goods that are relatively expensive at such outlets increased after the government handed out the relief funds.Sales of fruit, vegetables and foodstuff rose an average of 15 percent over last weekend from a week earlier, according to the convenience store chain CU. Sales of wine logged the fastest growth of 23.3 percent among liquors.""Smaller merchants and the self-employed are expected to see an improvement in business on the back of slowed virus spread and the emergency payout,"" the Ministry of SMEs and Startups said in a statement.

At the center of the campaign is the envisioned network called an alliance of ""trusted partners."" The US has not formally named them, but it indicated that South Korea is among targeted ones.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US is ""working closely with Vietnam, South Korea, New Zealand, Australia and India.""Australia and India are members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, also known as Quad, along with the US and Japan.The seven countries recently launched vice ministerial discussions on the coronavirus response.Washington's move poses yet another dilemma for its longtime ally Seoul, which has close economic ties with Beijing.It's reminiscent of a quandary over the Trump administration's India-Pacific strategy. South Korea has maintained a prudent stance, stating it is committed to harmonizing its New Southern Policy with the US initiative and China's Belt and Road campaign. (Yonhap)"

If the players are tied on one hole, the money at stake carries over to the next hole.The total purse is 100 million won (US$81,510), and the two players will donate their winnings to charities of their choices.The LPGA Tour has been on hold since mid-February due to the coronavirus pandemic, and Ko, who had planned to make her season debut in March, has yet to play a competitive round in 2020.Park had been in the same boat before making her first tournament appearance last week at the Korea Ladies Professional Golf Association (KLPGA) Championship. The rusty Park missed the cut.Ko enjoyed an outstanding 2019 season, counting two majors among her four titles while also sweeping the Player of the Year, the money title, the Vare Trophy as the scoring leader, and the Annika Major Award, given to the player with the best performance across five LPGA major tournaments. Ko won the Rookie of the Year in 2018.Park, former No. 1, won both the Rookie of the Year and the Player of the Year honors in 2017, becoming the first player to do so since Nancy Lopez in 1978. She has won seven LPGA titles, including a major each in 2017 and 2018.Due to lingering COVID-19 concerns, the skins match will be played without fans. The players, their caddies and other matchday officials must all go through temperature checks. (Yonhap)"

The military last reported a patient among its personnel on May 15, as an officer of the Cyber Operations Command in Seoul tested positive after having contact with an Army staff sergeant who contracted the virus after visiting clubs and bars in Seoul's multicultural district of Itaewon.So far, the number of coronavirus infections at barracks stands at 51, and 12 of them are related to the Itaewon club case, according to the defense ministry.On Friday, South Korea reported 20 more cases of the virus, bringing the nation's total infections to 11,142.

At least 207 infections here have been connected to the case.To avoid a second wave of infections, South Korea has been carrying out more than 77,000 tests on those who visited affected clubs between April 24 and May 6. The number of imported cases rose by nine from a day earlier, reaching 1,200. More than 88 percent of such patients were South Korean nationals returning from overseas.Authorities said the country is expected to experience a gradual increase in the number of imported cases, as it is inevitable for South Korea to maintain at least limited exchanges with other countries.The fatality rate came to 2.37 percent. South Korea has not yet reported any deaths from patients aged 29 and younger. It has also not yet seen a coronavirus-related syndrome among children as observed overseas. The total number of people released from quarantine after full recoveries stood at 10,162, up 27 from the previous day. The latest figures indicate that more than 90 percent of confirmed patients have fully recovered from the virus.South Korea has carried out tests on 802,418 people since Jan. 3, including 13,734 from a day earlier.The health authorities say they remain vigilant over sporadic group infections across the nation, though they say it is safe to deem the club-linked cases as now being under control.""The cases from Itaewon did not lead to a massive proliferation of the virus, but we are still experiencing local infections in the Seoul metropolitan area,"" Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip said during a daily briefing, hinting that karaoke rooms, PC cafes and bars are still among places vulnerable to the virus. Earlier this week, four nurses at Samsung Medical Center, one of the country's five major general hospitals, tested positive.Exactly how they became infected with the COVID-19 virus was not immediately known, but authorities say they have not found connections to the clubgoers.Dozens of high schools in Gyeonggi Province that surrounds Seoul ordered students to return home on Wednesday. Two high school students tested positive for COVID-19 in Incheon, in what could be infections tied to Itaewon.Another vocational school, in Daegu, once the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea, also closed down on Thursday after a student in a dormitory tested positive.South Korea, which normally starts the new school year in March, allowed high school seniors to return to classrooms on Wednesday, with a goal of having students of other grades gradually resume normal routines by early June.Health authorities said they are currently working to draw up new guidelines for students, as the upcoming summer heat is anticipated to make it more difficult for them to wear masks at all times.""The COVID-19 pandemic can never be eradicated unless there's a vaccine,"" Kim added. ""We will continue to experience sporadic infections in different corners of our daily lives.""The vice minister, however, said South Korea can nevertheless curb the pandemic if people continue to follow basic sanitary guidelines.

Comparable growth figures were 38 percent for drones and aviation goods, and about 25 percent for electric vehicles.Yet, first-quarter overseas shipments of new-energy items, robots and advanced new materials shrank slightly from a year earlier.South Korea's overall exports contracted 1.4 percent in the first quarter as overseas demand for its goods slackened due to the coronavirus outbreak that led to lockdowns, shuttered plants and dampened consumer spending across the globe.Stressing the need to nurture new promising export items to brace for a post-coronavirus period, KITA predicted global demand for health care products and digital equipment to grow further down the road.

We need it more than ever","Kim Hoo-ran","http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200521000640&ACE_SEARCH=1","  Months into the COVID-19 pandemic, life seems to have settled into a humdrum rhythm. Days pass like the swing of a pendulum -- back and forth, back and forth, from home to work, work to home. Yet, such regularity as I have not experienced in years does little to offer peace of mind or comfort. Beneath the surface calm is the constant whirring of the brain. Actions have consequences and in these perilous times, we are required to constantly make decisions that could potentially impact not only our own safety, but that of those closest to us -- family, friends and colleagues. If strict social distancing had made me feel relatively safe, the more relaxed social distancing now in place has made me more anxious. With the former, I was without choices; the latter means I need to make decisions based the perceived level of danger.Do I accept an invitation to a large dinner gathering of people that I do not know, where masks will be taken off to eat and drink? Am I putting myself at unnecessary risk by requesting an interview be held at a hospital where COVID-19 patients are being treated? Weighing the pros and cons of my plans can go on and on, and I admit I have lost sleep over them on many nights.And there is little respite from a brain on an overdrive, not even in one’s dreams. People around the world have reported having strange dreams in the time of the new coronavirus. On a recent night, I woke up in panic from a dream in which two burly security guards were approaching me as I sat on a church pew. Even in the dream, I felt the terror of having forgotten to wear a mask and realizing that the guards were about to grab me by the arms to escort me out. Mirth is in short supply these days. If listening to an episode of “All Creatures Great and Small” can make me break into a fit of hearty laughter on a drive to work, I know I am willing myself to laugh at even the smallest thing, just so I can feel what it is like to laugh. If something can take my mind off all the doom and gloom being forecast about the post - COVID-19 pandemic world, I’d say I am game.I would like to be moved, my soul stirred, to be transported away from the time and space that I occupy, if only for a few minutes. As most concerts around the world have been canceled, performances have moved to online platforms. I was struck by the brilliance of pianist Sunwoo Yekwon who posted on Instagram clips of Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1 and Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No.2 performances, playing both the piano and the orchestral parts. Rock star Yoon Do-hyun has really embraced the online platform, performing live concerts almost daily. His online sessions stand out for their intimacy, where he makes the viewers feel like they are actually meeting and talking face-to-face. The sound quality does not matter too much at this point.Yet, online concerts cannot replace the thrill of sitting in the concert hall, eagerly anticipating what is about to unfold onstage. The emotional and physical connections between the performers and the audience are absent, making it difficult to stay engaged. One misses the visceral emotions brought on by feeling the notes against the skin, breathing the same air.Therein lies the difficulty. Breathing the same air without having it filtered through a mask is now a risky behavior. Hence, the cancellation Wednesday of next week’s scheduled Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra concert. If a full orchestra performing in a large concert hall is not going to be possible in the foreseeable future, orchestras should look into alternatives. Outdoor performances by smaller ensembles, playing to an audience sitting far apart could be considered. It may be a cliché to say music has the power to heal. But music does heal and healing is done best when there is a communion of souls. And these days, there are many that yearn healing.By Kim Hoo-ran (khooran@heraldcorp.com)--The writer is the culture desk editor at The Korea Herald – Ed."
"10","May 22, 2020","The Korea Herald","Believers in the power of music to heal","Kim Hoo-ran","http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200521000893&ACE_SEARCH=1","    It had been raining all morning, when violist Richard Yongjae O’Neill stepped into the lobby of Myongji Hospital in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province, Tuesday for a special performance for the hospital’s staff and patients.The acclaimed violist began the concert with the familiar “Bach’s Air on the G String” from the program, which he designed to be meditative. It was an emotional performance for the musician, for whom this was the first live performance in front of an audience in several months. Among the audience were the hospital’s corona ward doctors and nurses seated in the “VIP” seats. In the 100 days since Korea’s coronavirus patient No. 3 was admitted to the hospital, two nurses have been infected. The ding of the elevator, the shuffling of the feet and the sound of wheels on beds transporting patients did not seem to bother the performer or the audience, one grateful for the privilege of playing and the others appreciating the opportunity to hear great music up close. O’Neill, who flew in from the US for Tuesday’s concert and Friday night’s Seoul Arts Center concert with violinist Yang In-mo, pianist Ilya Rashkovskly and the Ditto Chamber Ensemble, as well as next week’s recital at the Mapo Art Center marking the 15th anniversary of his debut, was in self-isolation for two weeks before the performance. His viola case, which typically has a few photos of people dear to him, was empty except for his instrument wrapped in an old Hermes scarf. When the absence of photos is pointed out, he says, “This reflects the current state of my mind.”O’Neill was in New York in March, rehearsing 12-13 hours a day for upcoming engagements, when his world turned upside down with the coronavirus’s onslaught in New York. “Within 24 hours, my slate was wiped clean,” he recalled in an interview with The Korea Herald held after the hospital concert. He canceled everything and took a flight to Los Angeles, where he remained in a shutdown until his flight to Seoul. He had left Korea in mid-February when Daegu was hit with a large cluster infection involving a religious group. He recalled being in Korea for all the major coronavirus-related epidemics: SARS in 2003 hit when he was in Seoul with the Sejong Soloists; MERS erupted in 2015 when he was in Korea and now COVID-19.The time spent in shutdown has had a positive side, according to O’Neill. “It was a good lesson to be with myself in stasis,” he said. “It was a challenge, but it was a reminder that every moment making music is a gift, but true gift is making music with others,” he said.“I missed it so much,” he said about performing in front of an audience. “I could not sleep last night. The whole world has shifted. I was getting in front of people with music for the first time in months,” he said. “I felt guilty in some way. I wish others could also play,” he said, adding, “Not being able to make music is very painful.” He noted a lot of existential crises. “We need to take care of each other. Top artists that are out of work, a lot of them are OK. But there is fear of survival among artists. People who have stability need to reach out and do what they can,” he said. He suggested not asking for refunds for tickets to events that have been canceled, for example. “We all need to chip in,” he said. “I love the concert hall and the whole environment. What about people who can’t go to concert halls?” O’Neill asked, relating his personal experience. Since last July, he had been spending a lot of time at the hospital with his mother. “Facing a life or death situation, you need some sort of solace, comfort. We should take care of each other.”The power of music to heal and comfort is not lost on Dr. Lee Wang-jun, chairman of Myongji Medical Foundation, who organized Tuesday’s concert after hearing about O’Neill’s wish to perform at the hospital. A patron of music who studied the violin, Lee has been putting on regular music concerts at the hospital. At the end of March, the hospital held a bedside concert for the COVID-19 patients it was treating. This month would have seen the hospital’s annual music festival but the coronavirus outbreak has put a halt to that. The hospital, which has nine negative pressure rooms, has so far treated 39 COVID-19 patients, including one who remains in hospital.   At Myongji Hospital, music is not just a complementary program but a proper entity in itself. “We have an independent Center of Arts and Healing, established in 2013, with 13-14 staff, offering programs in five areas. Music therapy is the most active of the programs,” Lee said. In the beginning, collaboration was difficult, Lee recalled. “I asked doctors to look for medical evidence (of art’s role in healing,)” he said. Now, doctors accept art programs as a regular partner of healing program and prescribe art programs as remedies. Currently 70 percent of the programs are covered by the national health insurance, according to Lee.Art programs have been shown to be especially effective in treating early dementia patients as well as rehabilitation of pediatric patients with developmental disabilities.The hospital’s concerts are not just for the patients. They are for the staff as well. “It is emotional labor and there is a lot of trauma. Music is the main part of resilience program,” he said. The hospital holds daily concerts in the lobby by some 56 participating teams and special performances are held on Saturdays. There is a Healing Concert every month as well as the annual Art Healing Festival that runs one to two weeks in May. “It is difficult to achieve horizontal relationship among doctors, medical staff and patients. I was looking for a way to break down the barriers between them and found the answer in art performances,” he said. For example, the Myongji Doctors’ Choir holds one to two concerts a year for the patients,Meanwhile, O’Neill suggests listening to the Goldberg Variations by J.S. Bach in the time of the coronavirus. “It is a 45-minute musical journey that is very complete. There is a lifetime in the piece,” he said. “All scenarios, all emotions, everything is hinted at in the first movement. When you realize it, it is over,” he explained. Bach wrote the music for a guy who could not sleep and the dedication page in the music book reads “To comfort the musician,” according to O’Neill. “It never fails to make me feel better.”By Kim Hoo-ran (khooran@heraldcorp.com)"

""(F)irst, to improve the resiliency of our institutions, alliances, and partnerships to prevail against the challenges the PRC presents; and second, to compel Beijing to cease or reduce actions harmful to the United States' vital, national interests and those of our allies and partners.""To support the ""shared principles of a free and open order,"" the US is building ""cooperative partnerships"" and ""developing positive alternatives"" with allies, partners and international organizations, according to the report.""The United States is working in concert with mutually aligned visions and approaches such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nation's Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, Japan's free and open Indo-Pacific vision, India's Security and Growth for All in the Region policy, Australia's Indo-Pacific concept, the Republic of Korea's New Southern Policy, and Taiwan's New Southbound Policy,"" it says.President Moon Jae-in's New Southern Policy focuses on deepening ties with Southeast Asian nations, but Seoul and Washington have sought to identify and build on areas where it overlaps with the US' Indo-Pacific Strategy.The report also accuses Beijing of using its economic clout to extract political concessions from other countries.""Beijing has restricted trade and tourism with Australia, Canada, South Korea, Japan, Norway, the Philippines, and others, and has detained Canadian citizens, in an effort to interfere in these countries' internal political and judicial processes,"" it says, apparently referring to China's economic retaliation for South Korea's hosting of a US missile defense system.

At that time, Korea received bailout funds from the International Monetary Fund to escape the crisis.The start of the dialogue shows how severe economic stagnation and workforce reductions are.According to Statistics Korea, the number of employees on furlough in April was 1.48 million, up 1.13 million from the same month last year. The number in March was 1.6 million, up 1.26 million from a year earlier. The numbers and margins of increase were the highest since related data was first compiled in July 1983.Workers on furlough are statistically classified as being employed. If economic stagnation is prolonged, they will likely become jobless or economically inactive. The World Health Organization warns that we are in for a long fight against the coronavirus disease.According to the Korea Labor & Society Institute, the number of employed in April was 1.02 million fewer than in February. For comparison purposes, the 1998 currency crisis put 920,000 people out of work in the first two months.Economically vulnerable groups, including irregular workers at small and medium-sized companies, were the first to be hit. Now an employment cliff is imminent for regular staff members at large companies. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy and Finance Hong Nam-ki said the government will create more than 550,000 jobs in the public sector, but fiscally created jobs are unsustainable. It is urgent to create jobs in the private sector.The goal of the dialogue is to minimize the negative impact of the coronavirus on employment. An employment cliff is a difficult problem because of the different positions of labor and business. Labor groups demand a ban on layoffs and a tighter safety net for those who are out of work, while businesses call for limits on wage hikes and flexibility in the application of regulations on the maximum number of working hours.A day before the dialogue, the Federation of Korean Trade Unions held a press conference in front of the Korea Enterprises Federation, a lobby for employers, and called for large companies to spend their cash reserves to keep their workers employed. This kind of pressure does not help solve the problem.Employment is possible when companies exist. Now, business performance is plummeting. The operating and net profits of Kospi-listed companies fell 31 percent and 48 percent year-on-year, respectively, in the first quarter. Their second-quarter results are expected to be worse.A survey shows massive layoffs will be inevitable in one-third of large companies if the economic shock from COVID-19 is prolonged for more than six months. Labor groups must not think that businesses are exaggerating their hardships to solicit as many concessions as possible.Differences in the positions of labor, management and the government are inevitable. But if one side sticks to its guns and tries to put pressure on the other, they can never reach an agreement. Under the common goal of reviving the economy and protecting jobs, both labor and management need to consider a middle ground, such as shortening working hours and sharing jobs. Participants in the dialogue must try to understand one another and figure out what to give rather than what to get.When negotiations are stalled, the mediating role of the government will be more important. The government vowed to offer incentives to companies if they maintain employment, but it must not end up with symptomatic therapy. It should try to grasp what is truly needed to sustain employment. The government must also try to dispel concerns that it is inclined toward labor.Employment shock and business difficulties are already a reality. Dialogue must proceed as efficiently and quickly as possible. It has just begun and must be continued. Self-restraint and willingness to share pains are required."

A second batch of rotational troops is scheduled to head to the African nation on June 1. (Yonhap)"

This year, the coverage should be raised to at least 30 million,” Ki said, adding that the vaccines should be given free of charge to people with preexisting medical conditions, health care workers and other workers whose jobs involve a lot of person-to-person interactions.Ki also pointed out falling ill with both COVID-19 and the flu was “an unfortunate possibility.”An article that appeared in the Lancet medical journal on May 5 said co-infection by both viruses -- the coronavirus and the influenza -- though rare, was feasible.“Those vulnerable from COVID-19 are also at increased risk from flu, which is why increased efforts are necessary to deliver flu vaccination more extensively,” said infectious disease expert Dr. Lee Jacob of Seoul’s Hallym University Hospital.By Kim Arin (arin@heraldcorp.com)"

The student was among the 17 students who got tested before moving into a school dormitory Wednesday. The patient was asymptomatic, according to the Daegu’s education office. The dorm inhabitants were put in isolation and other third graders were ordered to return home. The third graders and all teachers and employees will be tested for the virus, according to health authorities.  Under the guidelines on response to COVID-19 infection at schools, schools that see a confirmed patient will be shut down for two days and turn to remote learning. Hosted by the Gyeonggi Provincial Office of Education, the mock exam is virtually the first opportunity for third-year high school students to see where they stand on a national scale and explore possible options for college applications. The previous mock test, organized last month by the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education, was held online as schools were physically shut amid spread of the coronavirus. The test results were not provided. Attended by some 77.6 percent of the country’s high schools, or 1,835 schools, the mock test covers five subjects from Korean language to mathematics, with the test results to be released starting June. 5. Students attending 66 schools in five districts in Incheon, where two high school third graders tested positive for the virus on the first day of school reopening Wednesday, sat the exam online, as schools were closed again. Incheon’s education office is to decide on whether to resume in-person classes Friday.Students at nine schools in Anseong, Gyeonggi Province, which reopened Thursday, took the exam as scheduled. The school postponed its reopening amid incomplete contact tracing for a patient confirmed to be infected Wednesday. About 450,000 high school seniors on Wednesday returned to classrooms nearly three months later than usual. The students, who had attended classes online, were the first group to go back to school, given a hectic academic calendar until they sit the college entrance exam scheduled for Dec. 3. Despite lingering safety concerns, health and education authorities are adamant that reopening of schools should continue, with daily quarantine practices in place. “About the reopening of schools for high school seniors, we cannot help but continue to see confirmed patients because the virus might be spreading quietly in communities. The thing is how fast we discover the patients, respond and calmly take action,” Kwon Jun-wook, deputy director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a briefing Thursday.

Koreans still vulnerable to COVID-19: US State Department","Choi Si-young","http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200521000778&ACE_SEARCH=1","  North Koreans remain vulnerable to the novel coronavirus pandemic, despite Pyongyang’s repeated claims that it has no infections, the US State Department said Wednesday. The department, contacted by Radio Free Asia on Wednesday about the COVID-19 situation in the North, said the country was still “vulnerable” and asked the radio station to refer to its earlier statement on the matter. “We strongly support and encourage the work of US and international aid and health organizations to counter and contain the spread of coronavirus in the DPRK,” the State Department said in February, referring to the North by its official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.At a World Health Assembly teleconference Monday and Tuesday, the North requested the loosening of UN sanctions, saying in a statement made public on the website of the World Health Organization that the sanctions hampered intergovernmental cooperation to curb COVID-19.Bruce Klingner, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation think tank, described Pyongyang’s statement as disingenuous. Sanctions against North Korea should be kept in place until it dismantles its nuclear arsenal, he told the radio station. Meanwhile, the US Agriculture Department forecasts that North Korea’s rice output this year will hit its lowest point in 26 years. The communist country is expected to reap an estimated 1.36 million tons this year, as compared with about 1.5 million tons in 1994.North Korea would have to import about 220,000 tons of rice this year to ride out the impact of the lower output, according to a recent report from the department’s Economic Research Service.“Sanctions and the ongoing pandemic slashed rice production in Pyongyang,” said Kim Kwan-ho, a senior researcher at the Korea Rural Community Corporation.
