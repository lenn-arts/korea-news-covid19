The branches include the group's headquarters in Gwacheon, just south of Seoul, and facilities in the cities of Busan, Gwangju and Daejeon.The raid marks the prosecution's first forcible investigation into the group since February when a group of people who claimed to be victims of the religious group filed a complaint against the 89-year-old Lee for embezzlement, dereliction of duty and violation of infectious disease prevention laws.The group is accused of causing the country's biggest cluster outbreaks, accounting for some 47 percent of the country's total caseload of 11,142. Its worship services, where members sit close together and chant loud in poorly ventilated spaces, are believed to have been a factor in the rapid spread the virus. Also, Lee is accused of ordering group members not to fully cooperate with health officials, thus hindering state efforts to contain COVID-19 in the early stages of the pandemic. (Yonhap)"
"2","2020-05-22","The Korea Herald","OLED TV market may post relatively small growth this year: report","Yonhap","http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200522000392&ACE_SEARCH=1","  The global OLED TV market, led by South Korea's LG Electronics Inc., is expected to post relatively small growth this year, compared with the QLED TV sector, following a disruption in panel supply caused by the novel coronavirus pandemic, a market report showed Friday. The global OLED TV shipment is expected to increase 7.8 percent on-year to 3.375 million units this year, according to display market tracker WitsView, a research division of TrendForce. The figure was a 26.1 percent decrease from its original number forecasted earlier this year. OLED, or organic light-emitting diode, is highlighted by self-illuminating pixels that deliver perfect black, and it is the main display used for LG's high-end TVs.""The OLED TV market faces the dual headwinds of hindered panel supply and high retail prices,"" WitsView said. ""Both market leader LG Electronics and Sony have revised down their shipment targets for OLED TVs this year.""Industry insiders said that production delay from LG Display Co., the sole large-size OLED TV panel supplier in the world, will weigh down the industry. LG Display previously planned to have its OLED panel factory in Guangzhou, China, start mass production in the first quarter of the year, but it could not meet the schedule due to COVID-19 outbreak.The company recently said it plans to fully operate the Guangzhou factory within the first half of the year.  Industry observers said a sharp rise of QLED TVs can further limit OLED TV sales amid the pandemic. ""Aside from the pandemic-induced slowdown in OLED demand, the more flexible pricing of QLED products will also represent a substantial threat to the sales of OLED TVs this year, since the latter have historically maintained a high retail price,"" WitsView said. The global QLED TV shipment is expected to grow 41.8 percent on-year to reach 8.27 million units this year with aggressive sales promotions from the market leader Samsung Electronics Co., according to WitsView.QLED is Samsung's marketing term for its liquid crystal display (LCD) TVs using quantum-dot technology to enhance performance in key picture quality areas. Although overall global TV shipment is expected to suffer 5.8 percent on-year decline to 205.21 million units this year, WitsView said QLED TV sales can increase further.  ""In spite of the downturn in global TV shipment this year, the market for QLED products thrived on the flourishing stay-at-home economy as well as the sales promotions of Samsung Visual Display's older models in the first quarter of 2020, which resulted in retail price cuts of more than 20 percent for 65-inch QLED TVs in the North American market, incidentally creating a wave of replacement demand for new TV sets,"" it said. According to market tracker Omdia, Samsung was the top TV vendor in the January-March period as it accounted for 32.4 percent of the global TV market in terms of sales value. (Yonhap)"

People can use the emergency funds through either credit and debit cards or certificates by end-August.Small merchants' sales almost recovered to last year's level for the first time since the government raised its alert against COVID-19 to the highest level in late February, according to the data.""The emergency relief funds appear to affect consumption. This week, the impact is likely to be larger,"" KCD chief Kim Dong-ho said.An average of their revenues last week surpassed those tallied the previous year in areas such as Gyeonggi Province that surrounds Seoul and South Gyeongsang Province.The southeastern city of Daegu, once the epicenter of the virus outbreak here, and Seoul, meanwhile, saw small merchants' sales almost recover to last year's level, the data showed.The South Korean economy shrank 1.4 percent on-quarter in the first quarter as the coronavirus outbreak dented consumer spending and exports. Private consumption declined 6.4 percent on-quarter in the cited period.South Koreans are using the relief funds at various locations ranging from small supermarkets, restaurants and beauty salons to traditional markets.According to data compiled by three major convenient stores, demand for daily necessities and goods that are relatively expensive at such outlets increased after the government handed out the relief funds.Sales of fruit, vegetables and foodstuff rose an average of 15 percent over last weekend from a week earlier, according to the convenience store chain CU. Sales of wine logged the fastest growth of 23.3 percent among liquors.""Smaller merchants and the self-employed are expected to see an improvement in business on the back of slowed virus spread and the emergency payout,"" the Ministry of SMEs and Startups said in a statement.

At the center of the campaign is the envisioned network called an alliance of ""trusted partners."" The US has not formally named them, but it indicated that South Korea is among targeted ones.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US is ""working closely with Vietnam, South Korea, New Zealand, Australia and India.""Australia and India are members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, also known as Quad, along with the US and Japan.The seven countries recently launched vice ministerial discussions on the coronavirus response.Washington's move poses yet another dilemma for its longtime ally Seoul, which has close economic ties with Beijing.It's reminiscent of a quandary over the Trump administration's India-Pacific strategy. South Korea has maintained a prudent stance, stating it is committed to harmonizing its New Southern Policy with the US initiative and China's Belt and Road campaign. (Yonhap)"

If the players are tied on one hole, the money at stake carries over to the next hole.The total purse is 100 million won (US$81,510), and the two players will donate their winnings to charities of their choices.The LPGA Tour has been on hold since mid-February due to the coronavirus pandemic, and Ko, who had planned to make her season debut in March, has yet to play a competitive round in 2020.Park had been in the same boat before making her first tournament appearance last week at the Korea Ladies Professional Golf Association (KLPGA) Championship. The rusty Park missed the cut.Ko enjoyed an outstanding 2019 season, counting two majors among her four titles while also sweeping the Player of the Year, the money title, the Vare Trophy as the scoring leader, and the Annika Major Award, given to the player with the best performance across five LPGA major tournaments. Ko won the Rookie of the Year in 2018.Park, former No. 1, won both the Rookie of the Year and the Player of the Year honors in 2017, becoming the first player to do so since Nancy Lopez in 1978. She has won seven LPGA titles, including a major each in 2017 and 2018.Due to lingering COVID-19 concerns, the skins match will be played without fans. The players, their caddies and other matchday officials must all go through temperature checks. (Yonhap)"

The military last reported a patient among its personnel on May 15, as an officer of the Cyber Operations Command in Seoul tested positive after having contact with an Army staff sergeant who contracted the virus after visiting clubs and bars in Seoul's multicultural district of Itaewon.So far, the number of coronavirus infections at barracks stands at 51, and 12 of them are related to the Itaewon club case, according to the defense ministry.On Friday, South Korea reported 20 more cases of the virus, bringing the nation's total infections to 11,142.

Korea reports 20 new virus cases amid efforts to contain sporadic infections","Yonhap","http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200522000198&ACE_SEARCH=1","  South Korea reported 20 more cases of the new coronavirus Friday as health officials are trying to contain sporadic group infections following the mass spread of the virus tied to Seoul's nightlife district of Itaewon.The new cases raised South Korea's total caseload to 11,142, and the nation's death toll remained unchanged at 264, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).Itaewon has emerged as a hotbed for infections as a 29-year-old man tested positive for COVID-19 on May 6 following his visits to multiple clubs and bars in Itaewon. At least 207 infections here have been connected to the case.To avoid a second wave of infections, South Korea has been carrying out more than 77,000 tests on those who visited affected clubs between April 24 and May 6. The number of imported cases rose by nine from a day earlier, reaching 1,200. More than 88 percent of such patients were South Korean nationals returning from overseas.Authorities said the country is expected to experience a gradual increase in the number of imported cases, as it is inevitable for South Korea to maintain at least limited exchanges with other countries.The fatality rate came to 2.37 percent. South Korea has not yet reported any deaths from patients aged 29 and younger. It has also not yet seen a coronavirus-related syndrome among children as observed overseas. The total number of people released from quarantine after full recoveries stood at 10,162, up 27 from the previous day. The latest figures indicate that more than 90 percent of confirmed patients have fully recovered from the virus.South Korea has carried out tests on 802,418 people since Jan. 3, including 13,734 from a day earlier.The health authorities say they remain vigilant over sporadic group infections across the nation, though they say it is safe to deem the club-linked cases as now being under control.""The cases from Itaewon did not lead to a massive proliferation of the virus, but we are still experiencing local infections in the Seoul metropolitan area,"" Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip said during a daily briefing, hinting that karaoke rooms, PC cafes and bars are still among places vulnerable to the virus. Earlier this week, four nurses at Samsung Medical Center, one of the country's five major general hospitals, tested positive.Exactly how they became infected with the COVID-19 virus was not immediately known, but authorities say they have not found connections to the clubgoers.Dozens of high schools in Gyeonggi Province that surrounds Seoul ordered students to return home on Wednesday. Two high school students tested positive for COVID-19 in Incheon, in what could be infections tied to Itaewon.Another vocational school, in Daegu, once the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea, also closed down on Thursday after a student in a dormitory tested positive.South Korea, which normally starts the new school year in March, allowed high school seniors to return to classrooms on Wednesday, with a goal of having students of other grades gradually resume normal routines by early June.Health authorities said they are currently working to draw up new guidelines for students, as the upcoming summer heat is anticipated to make it more difficult for them to wear masks at all times.""The COVID-19 pandemic can never be eradicated unless there's a vaccine,"" Kim added. ""We will continue to experience sporadic infections in different corners of our daily lives.""The vice minister, however, said South Korea can nevertheless curb the pandemic if people continue to follow basic sanitary guidelines.

Comparable growth figures were 38 percent for drones and aviation goods, and about 25 percent for electric vehicles.Yet, first-quarter overseas shipments of new-energy items, robots and advanced new materials shrank slightly from a year earlier.South Korea's overall exports contracted 1.4 percent in the first quarter as overseas demand for its goods slackened due to the coronavirus outbreak that led to lockdowns, shuttered plants and dampened consumer spending across the globe.Stressing the need to nurture new promising export items to brace for a post-coronavirus period, KITA predicted global demand for health care products and digital equipment to grow further down the road.

We need it more than ever","Kim Hoo-ran","http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200521000640&ACE_SEARCH=1","  Months into the COVID-19 pandemic, life seems to have settled into a humdrum rhythm. Days pass like the swing of a pendulum -- back and forth, back and forth, from home to work, work to home. Yet, such regularity as I have not experienced in years does little to offer peace of mind or comfort. Beneath the surface calm is the constant whirring of the brain. Actions have consequences and in these perilous times, we are required to constantly make decisions that could potentially impact not only our own safety, but that of those closest to us -- family, friends and colleagues. If strict social distancing had made me feel relatively safe, the more relaxed social distancing now in place has made me more anxious. With the former, I was without choices; the latter means I need to make decisions based the perceived level of danger.Do I accept an invitation to a large dinner gathering of people that I do not know, where masks will be taken off to eat and drink? Am I putting myself at unnecessary risk by requesting an interview be held at a hospital where COVID-19 patients are being treated? Weighing the pros and cons of my plans can go on and on, and I admit I have lost sleep over them on many nights.And there is little respite from a brain on an overdrive, not even in one’s dreams. People around the world have reported having strange dreams in the time of the new coronavirus. On a recent night, I woke up in panic from a dream in which two burly security guards were approaching me as I sat on a church pew. Even in the dream, I felt the terror of having forgotten to wear a mask and realizing that the guards were about to grab me by the arms to escort me out. Mirth is in short supply these days. If listening to an episode of “All Creatures Great and Small” can make me break into a fit of hearty laughter on a drive to work, I know I am willing myself to laugh at even the smallest thing, just so I can feel what it is like to laugh. If something can take my mind off all the doom and gloom being forecast about the post - COVID-19 pandemic world, I’d say I am game.I would like to be moved, my soul stirred, to be transported away from the time and space that I occupy, if only for a few minutes. As most concerts around the world have been canceled, performances have moved to online platforms. I was struck by the brilliance of pianist Sunwoo Yekwon who posted on Instagram clips of Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1 and Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No.2 performances, playing both the piano and the orchestral parts. Rock star Yoon Do-hyun has really embraced the online platform, performing live concerts almost daily. His online sessions stand out for their intimacy, where he makes the viewers feel like they are actually meeting and talking face-to-face. The sound quality does not matter too much at this point.Yet, online concerts cannot replace the thrill of sitting in the concert hall, eagerly anticipating what is about to unfold onstage. The emotional and physical connections between the performers and the audience are absent, making it difficult to stay engaged. One misses the visceral emotions brought on by feeling the notes against the skin, breathing the same air.Therein lies the difficulty. Breathing the same air without having it filtered through a mask is now a risky behavior. Hence, the cancellation Wednesday of next week’s scheduled Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra concert. If a full orchestra performing in a large concert hall is not going to be possible in the foreseeable future, orchestras should look into alternatives. Outdoor performances by smaller ensembles, playing to an audience sitting far apart could be considered. It may be a cliché to say music has the power to heal. But music does heal and healing is done best when there is a communion of souls. And these days, there are many that yearn healing.By Kim Hoo-ran (khooran@heraldcorp.com)--The writer is the culture desk editor at The Korea Herald – Ed."
"10","2020-05-22","The Korea Herald","Believers in the power of music to heal","Kim Hoo-ran","http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200521000893&ACE_SEARCH=1","    It had been raining all morning, when violist Richard Yongjae O’Neill stepped into the lobby of Myongji Hospital in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province, Tuesday for a special performance for the hospital’s staff and patients.The acclaimed violist began the concert with the familiar “Bach’s Air on the G String” from the program, which he designed to be meditative. It was an emotional performance for the musician, for whom this was the first live performance in front of an audience in several months. Among the audience were the hospital’s corona ward doctors and nurses seated in the “VIP” seats. In the 100 days since Korea’s coronavirus patient No. 3 was admitted to the hospital, two nurses have been infected. The ding of the elevator, the shuffling of the feet and the sound of wheels on beds transporting patients did not seem to bother the performer or the audience, one grateful for the privilege of playing and the others appreciating the opportunity to hear great music up close. O’Neill, who flew in from the US for Tuesday’s concert and Friday night’s Seoul Arts Center concert with violinist Yang In-mo, pianist Ilya Rashkovskly and the Ditto Chamber Ensemble, as well as next week’s recital at the Mapo Art Center marking the 15th anniversary of his debut, was in self-isolation for two weeks before the performance. His viola case, which typically has a few photos of people dear to him, was empty except for his instrument wrapped in an old Hermes scarf. When the absence of photos is pointed out, he says, “This reflects the current state of my mind.”O’Neill was in New York in March, rehearsing 12-13 hours a day for upcoming engagements, when his world turned upside down with the coronavirus’s onslaught in New York. “Within 24 hours, my slate was wiped clean,” he recalled in an interview with The Korea Herald held after the hospital concert. He canceled everything and took a flight to Los Angeles, where he remained in a shutdown until his flight to Seoul. He had left Korea in mid-February when Daegu was hit with a large cluster infection involving a religious group. He recalled being in Korea for all the major coronavirus-related epidemics: SARS in 2003 hit when he was in Seoul with the Sejong Soloists; MERS erupted in 2015 when he was in Korea and now COVID-19.The time spent in shutdown has had a positive side, according to O’Neill. “It was a good lesson to be with myself in stasis,” he said. “It was a challenge, but it was a reminder that every moment making music is a gift, but true gift is making music with others,” he said.“I missed it so much,” he said about performing in front of an audience. “I could not sleep last night. The whole world has shifted. I was getting in front of people with music for the first time in months,” he said. “I felt guilty in some way. I wish others could also play,” he said, adding, “Not being able to make music is very painful.” He noted a lot of existential crises. “We need to take care of each other. Top artists that are out of work, a lot of them are OK. But there is fear of survival among artists. People who have stability need to reach out and do what they can,” he said. He suggested not asking for refunds for tickets to events that have been canceled, for example. “We all need to chip in,” he said. “I love the concert hall and the whole environment. What about people who can’t go to concert halls?” O’Neill asked, relating his personal experience. Since last July, he had been spending a lot of time at the hospital with his mother. “Facing a life or death situation, you need some sort of solace, comfort. We should take care of each other.”The power of music to heal and comfort is not lost on Dr. Lee Wang-jun, chairman of Myongji Medical Foundation, who organized Tuesday’s concert after hearing about O’Neill’s wish to perform at the hospital. A patron of music who studied the violin, Lee has been putting on regular music concerts at the hospital. At the end of March, the hospital held a bedside concert for the COVID-19 patients it was treating. This month would have seen the hospital’s annual music festival but the coronavirus outbreak has put a halt to that. The hospital, which has nine negative pressure rooms, has so far treated 39 COVID-19 patients, including one who remains in hospital.   At Myongji Hospital, music is not just a complementary program but a proper entity in itself. “We have an independent Center of Arts and Healing, established in 2013, with 13-14 staff, offering programs in five areas. Music therapy is the most active of the programs,” Lee said. In the beginning, collaboration was difficult, Lee recalled. “I asked doctors to look for medical evidence (of art’s role in healing,)” he said. Now, doctors accept art programs as a regular partner of healing program and prescribe art programs as remedies. Currently 70 percent of the programs are covered by the national health insurance, according to Lee.Art programs have been shown to be especially effective in treating early dementia patients as well as rehabilitation of pediatric patients with developmental disabilities.The hospital’s concerts are not just for the patients. They are for the staff as well. “It is emotional labor and there is a lot of trauma. Music is the main part of resilience program,” he said. The hospital holds daily concerts in the lobby by some 56 participating teams and special performances are held on Saturdays. There is a Healing Concert every month as well as the annual Art Healing Festival that runs one to two weeks in May. “It is difficult to achieve horizontal relationship among doctors, medical staff and patients. I was looking for a way to break down the barriers between them and found the answer in art performances,” he said. For example, the Myongji Doctors’ Choir holds one to two concerts a year for the patients,Meanwhile, O’Neill suggests listening to the Goldberg Variations by J.S. Bach in the time of the coronavirus. “It is a 45-minute musical journey that is very complete. There is a lifetime in the piece,” he said. “All scenarios, all emotions, everything is hinted at in the first movement. When you realize it, it is over,” he explained. Bach wrote the music for a guy who could not sleep and the dedication page in the music book reads “To comfort the musician,” according to O’Neill. “It never fails to make me feel better.”By Kim Hoo-ran (khooran@heraldcorp.com)"

""(F)irst, to improve the resiliency of our institutions, alliances, and partnerships to prevail against the challenges the PRC presents; and second, to compel Beijing to cease or reduce actions harmful to the United States' vital, national interests and those of our allies and partners.""To support the ""shared principles of a free and open order,"" the US is building ""cooperative partnerships"" and ""developing positive alternatives"" with allies, partners and international organizations, according to the report.""The United States is working in concert with mutually aligned visions and approaches such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nation's Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, Japan's free and open Indo-Pacific vision, India's Security and Growth for All in the Region policy, Australia's Indo-Pacific concept, the Republic of Korea's New Southern Policy, and Taiwan's New Southbound Policy,"" it says.President Moon Jae-in's New Southern Policy focuses on deepening ties with Southeast Asian nations, but Seoul and Washington have sought to identify and build on areas where it overlaps with the US' Indo-Pacific Strategy.The report also accuses Beijing of using its economic clout to extract political concessions from other countries.""Beijing has restricted trade and tourism with Australia, Canada, South Korea, Japan, Norway, the Philippines, and others, and has detained Canadian citizens, in an effort to interfere in these countries' internal political and judicial processes,"" it says, apparently referring to China's economic retaliation for South Korea's hosting of a US missile defense system.

At that time, Korea received bailout funds from the International Monetary Fund to escape the crisis.The start of the dialogue shows how severe economic stagnation and workforce reductions are.According to Statistics Korea, the number of employees on furlough in April was 1.48 million, up 1.13 million from the same month last year. The number in March was 1.6 million, up 1.26 million from a year earlier. The numbers and margins of increase were the highest since related data was first compiled in July 1983.Workers on furlough are statistically classified as being employed. If economic stagnation is prolonged, they will likely become jobless or economically inactive. The World Health Organization warns that we are in for a long fight against the coronavirus disease.According to the Korea Labor & Society Institute, the number of employed in April was 1.02 million fewer than in February. For comparison purposes, the 1998 currency crisis put 920,000 people out of work in the first two months.Economically vulnerable groups, including irregular workers at small and medium-sized companies, were the first to be hit. Now an employment cliff is imminent for regular staff members at large companies. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy and Finance Hong Nam-ki said the government will create more than 550,000 jobs in the public sector, but fiscally created jobs are unsustainable. It is urgent to create jobs in the private sector.The goal of the dialogue is to minimize the negative impact of the coronavirus on employment. An employment cliff is a difficult problem because of the different positions of labor and business. Labor groups demand a ban on layoffs and a tighter safety net for those who are out of work, while businesses call for limits on wage hikes and flexibility in the application of regulations on the maximum number of working hours.A day before the dialogue, the Federation of Korean Trade Unions held a press conference in front of the Korea Enterprises Federation, a lobby for employers, and called for large companies to spend their cash reserves to keep their workers employed. This kind of pressure does not help solve the problem.Employment is possible when companies exist. Now, business performance is plummeting. The operating and net profits of Kospi-listed companies fell 31 percent and 48 percent year-on-year, respectively, in the first quarter. Their second-quarter results are expected to be worse.A survey shows massive layoffs will be inevitable in one-third of large companies if the economic shock from COVID-19 is prolonged for more than six months. Labor groups must not think that businesses are exaggerating their hardships to solicit as many concessions as possible.Differences in the positions of labor, management and the government are inevitable. But if one side sticks to its guns and tries to put pressure on the other, they can never reach an agreement. Under the common goal of reviving the economy and protecting jobs, both labor and management need to consider a middle ground, such as shortening working hours and sharing jobs. Participants in the dialogue must try to understand one another and figure out what to give rather than what to get.When negotiations are stalled, the mediating role of the government will be more important. The government vowed to offer incentives to companies if they maintain employment, but it must not end up with symptomatic therapy. It should try to grasp what is truly needed to sustain employment. The government must also try to dispel concerns that it is inclined toward labor.Employment shock and business difficulties are already a reality. Dialogue must proceed as efficiently and quickly as possible. It has just begun and must be continued. Self-restraint and willingness to share pains are required."

This year, the coverage should be raised to at least 30 million,” Ki said, adding that the vaccines should be given free of charge to people with preexisting medical conditions, health care workers and other workers whose jobs involve a lot of person-to-person interactions.Ki also pointed out falling ill with both COVID-19 and the flu was “an unfortunate possibility.”An article that appeared in the Lancet medical journal on May 5 said co-infection by both viruses -- the coronavirus and the influenza -- though rare, was feasible.“Those vulnerable from COVID-19 are also at increased risk from flu, which is why increased efforts are necessary to deliver flu vaccination more extensively,” said infectious disease expert Dr. Lee Jacob of Seoul’s Hallym University Hospital.By Kim Arin (arin@heraldcorp.com)"

The student was among the 17 students who got tested before moving into a school dormitory Wednesday. The patient was asymptomatic, according to the Daegu’s education office. The dorm inhabitants were put in isolation and other third graders were ordered to return home. The third graders and all teachers and employees will be tested for the virus, according to health authorities.  Under the guidelines on response to COVID-19 infection at schools, schools that see a confirmed patient will be shut down for two days and turn to remote learning. Hosted by the Gyeonggi Provincial Office of Education, the mock exam is virtually the first opportunity for third-year high school students to see where they stand on a national scale and explore possible options for college applications. The previous mock test, organized last month by the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education, was held online as schools were physically shut amid spread of the coronavirus. The test results were not provided. Attended by some 77.6 percent of the country’s high schools, or 1,835 schools, the mock test covers five subjects from Korean language to mathematics, with the test results to be released starting June. 5. Students attending 66 schools in five districts in Incheon, where two high school third graders tested positive for the virus on the first day of school reopening Wednesday, sat the exam online, as schools were closed again. Incheon’s education office is to decide on whether to resume in-person classes Friday.Students at nine schools in Anseong, Gyeonggi Province, which reopened Thursday, took the exam as scheduled. The school postponed its reopening amid incomplete contact tracing for a patient confirmed to be infected Wednesday. About 450,000 high school seniors on Wednesday returned to classrooms nearly three months later than usual. The students, who had attended classes online, were the first group to go back to school, given a hectic academic calendar until they sit the college entrance exam scheduled for Dec. 3. Despite lingering safety concerns, health and education authorities are adamant that reopening of schools should continue, with daily quarantine practices in place. “About the reopening of schools for high school seniors, we cannot help but continue to see confirmed patients because the virus might be spreading quietly in communities. The thing is how fast we discover the patients, respond and calmly take action,” Kwon Jun-wook, deputy director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a briefing Thursday.

The department, contacted by Radio Free Asia on Wednesday about the COVID-19 situation in the North, said the country was still “vulnerable” and asked the radio station to refer to its earlier statement on the matter. “We strongly support and encourage the work of US and international aid and health organizations to counter and contain the spread of coronavirus in the DPRK,” the State Department said in February, referring to the North by its official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.At a World Health Assembly teleconference Monday and Tuesday, the North requested the loosening of UN sanctions, saying in a statement made public on the website of the World Health Organization that the sanctions hampered intergovernmental cooperation to curb COVID-19.Bruce Klingner, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation think tank, described Pyongyang’s statement as disingenuous. Sanctions against North Korea should be kept in place until it dismantles its nuclear arsenal, he told the radio station. Meanwhile, the US Agriculture Department forecasts that North Korea’s rice output this year will hit its lowest point in 26 years. The communist country is expected to reap an estimated 1.36 million tons this year, as compared with about 1.5 million tons in 1994.North Korea would have to import about 220,000 tons of rice this year to ride out the impact of the lower output, according to a recent report from the department’s Economic Research Service.“Sanctions and the ongoing pandemic slashed rice production in Pyongyang,” said Kim Kwan-ho, a senior researcher at the Korea Rural Community Corporation.

Clark Equipment’s leveraging plan is adding a financial burden to Doosan Bobcat, as affiliates and subsidiaries of conglomerate Doosan Group‘s liquidity crunch might spill over to Doosan Bobcat that is already suffering a sharp fall in sales due to the ongoing coronavirus crisis, according to credit rating agencies Thursday.Moody’s Investor Service revised down the corporate credit outlook of Doosan Bobcat, which guaranteed the bonds, from “positive,” to “stable,” while affirming its “Ba3,” rating.“The change in Doosan Bobcat’s outlook to stable from positive reflects our expectation that its financial leverage over the next 12-18 months will increase because of softer earnings and an increase in debt, as well as increased group-related risks,” noted Moody’s Vice President and Senior Credit Officer Yoo Wan-hee.“That said, these risks are partly offset by Doosan Bobcat’s leadership position in its key markets, significant financial headroom as of the end of 2019, and good liquidity,” he added. Meanwhile, S&P Global Ratings maintained its negative outlook for its “BB” ratings.“We expect debt growth combined with weakening operating performance will narrow the buffer in our issuer credit rating on Doosan Bobcat,” noted Kim Min-jib, credit analyst at S&P Global.“The negative outlook on Doosan Bobcat reflects our view that the company’s overall credit profile will be under pressure for the next six to 12 months due to weaker earnings and liquidity pressure on the credit profile of its parent group, while the full effects of the COVID-19 pandemic remain highly uncertain,” Kim added.Doosan Bobcat guarantees a combined $1.2 billion worth of outstanding debt held by Clark Equipment.Both Moody’s and S&P Global said the parent group Doosan’s exacerbating debt condition is leaving Doosan Bobcat prone to higher liquidity risks. Doosan Bobcat is 51.05 percent owned by Doosan Infracore, machinery manufacturing unit of Doosan Group. The equipment maker is likely to be affected by the risk-averse stance in the domestic funding market that could disrupt Doosan Infracore’s refinancing effort, according to S&P Global.“Parent company Doosan Infracore’s relatively weak liquidity also pressures our issuer credit rating on Doosan Bobcat,” noted Kim. “Doosan Infracore’s heavy reliance on short-term debt (more than half of total debt) and ongoing refinancing needs expose the group to volatility in the funding market, which has become increasingly risk-averse.”Also, the financial trouble of Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction -- which owns 36.27 percent of Doosan Infracore -- could spill over to Doosan Bobcat, Moody’s noted. Facing heat from dwindling demand for fossil fuel power plants and nuclear power plants, Doosan Heavy is under a self-rescue plan that involves layoffs and sales of key affiliates, in exchange for a 2.4 trillion won ($1.9 billion) bailout loan from state-run lenders.“The ratings could also be strained if the credit quality of Doosan Bobcat’s immediate parent deteriorates meaningfully,” Yoo wrote. “While these developments are negative for Doosan Bobcat’s credit quality and expose the company to a certain degree of event risk, these risks are partly offset by Doosan Bobcat’s listed status and the policy banks’ liquidity support for Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction.” Doosan, a holding company of Doosan Group, recorded a 379.9 billion won net loss in the first quarter, a sharp turnaround from 54.9 billion won net profit a year prior, according to its consolidated financial statement.By Son Ji-hyoung (consnow@heraldcorp.com)"

In a bid to supply more dollars to local markets, the government eased the LCR rule in March. The LCR ratio for banks was relaxed to 70 percent from 80 percent.

The May 24 Measures were imposed in 2010 by the Lee Myung-bak administration, in response to the North’s attack on the South Korean naval vessel Cheonan, resulting in the death of 46 Navy sailors. The measure cut almost all trade and investment, with the exception of those related to the now-defunct Kaesong industrial park and Kumgangsan tours. The measure also prohibits humanitarian aid without government permission. The measures no longer hold in reality, as previous governments have been flexible and allowed exceptions. But those that overlap with US and UN sanctions are still in force, the ministry said.   In response to Seoul’s remark, the US said it supports inter-Korean cooperation. “The United States supports inter-Korean cooperation and coordinates with our ROK ally to ensure inter-Korean cooperation proceeds in lockstep with progress on denuclearization,” an official at the State Department said, according to Voice of America. Seoul has been voicing for boosting cross-border projects that could be a breakthrough for inter-Korean relations, with less dependency on halted denuclearization negotiations between the US and North Korea. President Moon Jae-in has suggested quarantine cooperation amid coronavirus pandemic, as well as inter-Korean railway projects and individual tour to the North, but Pyongyang hasn’t responded to any of Seoul’s proposals since early this year. By Ahn Sung-mi (sahn@heraldcorp.com)"

The average household earned 5.35 million won ($4,357) per month in the first quarter, up 3.7 percent from the previous year, according to the report by Statistics Korea.Household income earned through wages rose 1.8 percent on-year, and income from business operations gained 2.2 percent in the first quarter. The average monthly income of the bottom 20 percent income bracket was unchanged at 1.49 million won in the first quarter. In contrast, households in the upper 20 percent income range earned 11.15 million won per month in the first quarter, up 6.3 percent from a year earlier.Consequently, the country's distribution ratio for disposable income, a key barometer of earnings equality, reached 5.41 in the first quarter, up 0.23 percentage points from a year earlier. A bigger ratio means increased inequality in income distribution.Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki told a meeting with economy-related ministers that the income gap is expected to further widen in the second quarter, as the pandemic has taken a heavy toll on part-time and freelance jobs. Hong said the government will make utmost efforts to prevent the income gap from worsening. The government will also spare no efforts for a faster post-pandemic economic recovery and job creation, Hong said. Last week, the government said it aims to create 1.56 million jobs in the public sector, as the nation's economy suffered its sharpest job losses in 21 years over the coronavirus pandemic. The number of employed people in South Korea stood at 26.56 million in April, 476,000 people fewer than a year ago, marking the biggest on-year decline since February 1999. With companies slashing hiring and the virus cutting social activities, economists say the worst has yet to come, heightening the urgency of the government's efforts to project jobs. South Korea has promised relief packages worth some 240 trillion won to ease the economic fallout from the virus.The nation's economy shrank 1.4 percent on-quarter in the first quarter of the year, marking the sharpest quarterly contraction since the last three months of 2008.

Despite the slowing of new cases, symptomless or minimally symptomatic spread among the younger population remains a challenge for containment efforts, public health authorities said.Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Deputy Director Kwon Jun-wook said in a Thursday briefing that 10 out of 12 new cases were local cases, mostly linked to the early May outbreak in Itaewon, a nightlife district in Seoul. Of the 201 virus patients with ties to Itaewon, 95 were visitors of the nightclubs and 111 were their contacts, he said.“Virus transmission can occur in any settings where people gather and have contact,” the deputy director said, warning that “no one, not even young people, is immune from infection.”“Social distancing, maintaining personal hygiene and cough etiquette remain our best defense against the virus,” he said.Korea has tested 788,684 people so far to find that 11,122 were infected. Over 91 of the patients, or 10,135, have been released from care after recovering.One death linked to the virus was reported Thursday, with the fatality rate standing at 2.1 percent. The death toll now totals 264.Health Minister Park Neung-hoo said in a Central Disaster Management Headquarters meeting Thursday morning that the outbreak in Itaewon had “spread mainly through facilities where there had been a lack of safety precautions.”To prevent future lapses, “a more coherent infection surveillance system” will be established, he said.The minister stressed that because schools are back in session, students are strongly urged not to go to places where there is a high risk of infection, such as gaming cafes and any place where wearing face masks and keeping distance are not viable.In Incheon, where a series of fresh infections forced 66 high schools to suspend classes yet again, all karaoke bars are ordered to close from Thursday, health officials said. The measure comes after two high school seniors there were found on Wednesday to have contracted the virus after visiting karaoke lounges.“Given Incheon’s proximity to densely populated Seoul, delays in contact tracing can lead to large-scale transmissions,” said senior health official Yoon Tae-ho during a press briefing Thursday morning, urging people to get tested if they had been to places where infections had been detected.Since the first case in the Itaewon cluster was discovered May 6, at least 248 visitors to nightspots in the area remained unreachable, he said.Addressing the recent infections among health care workers at Samsung Medical Center in Seoul, the city’s health officials said they were testing over 1,400 people who may have been exposed. After a nurse tested positive on Monday, three more cases at the hospital have been confirmed.Meanwhile, in the past 24 hours, the world saw the largest single-day increase in new cases of 106,000, according to the World Health Organization, which said the global total was nearing 5 million.“We still have a long way to go in this pandemic,” said the chief of the United Nations agency, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in a Thursday media briefing.“But the good news is that it has been particularly impressive to see how countries like the Republic of Korea have built on their experience of MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) to quickly implement a comprehensive strategy to find, isolate and care for every case and trace every contact,” he said.This approach, he added, was critical to Korea “curtailing the first wave and now quickly identifying and containing new outbreaks.”By Kim Arin (arin@heraldcorp.com)"

The budget carrier has suspended all of its international flights since March 8 as countries strengthen entry restrictions on incoming passengers amid virus fears. Air Seoul, another budget carrier affiliate of Asiana Airlines, also plans to resume international flights in July as it expects eased entry restrictions in Asia.Jeju Air, South Korea's biggest budget carrier, currently flies on routes to Tokyo, Osaka, and Weihai, though there is only a small number of incoming passengers.  Still, officials from other budget carriers remain cautious about the resumption of international flights as it is uncertain whether the COVID-19 virus will slow down by June.Jin Air, a budget carrier affiliate of Korean Air Lines Co., said it has no plan to resume flights from July as it remains to be seen whether countries will ease or lift entry restrictions on incoming passengers. Eastar Jet, T'way Air Co. and Fly Gangwon have suspended all of their flights on international routes. On the full-service carrier front, Korean Air and Asiana have suspended more than 90 percent of their flights on long-haul routes since March. The country's two biggest carriers plan to resume flights on dozens of their international routes from June as they prepare for increased travel demand after countries ease entry restrictions.

Of them, 10 were local infections.The country reported 32 COVID-19 cases Wednesday, marking the largest uptick in nine days, as it reeled from a steady rise in nightclub-related cases in Itaewon, a popular nightlife area in the capital.South Korea has successfully flattened the virus curve with massive and swift testing, but sporadic cluster infections continue to complicate public health authorities' quarantine efforts.Cases tied to clubs in Itaewon have not evolved into explosive infections but have continued to increase steadily. The number of virus cases linked to the Itaewon cluster reached 206 as of noon, with 10 new patients added over the past 24 hours.Itaewon emerged as a hotbed for infections after a 29-year-old man tested positive for COVID-19 on May 6 following visits to clubs in the district in early May.The country continued to report secondary and tertiary transmissions linked to the Itaewon outbreak.To stem further community spread, the city government in Incheon, west of Seoul, ordered some 2,400 karaoke facilities in the city not to host customers for two weeks, virtually suspending businesses at such places.Incheon reported 40 cases tied to Itaewon clubs as of noon, trailing 101 cases in Seoul and 45 in Gyeonggi Province that surrounds the capital.The government said it is considering implementing the same administrative order nationwide as more infections tied to karaoke facilities have been reported.""The Itaewon outbreak has not led to massive virus spread, but related infections have been reported consistently. That's why health authorities cannot loosen their guard against community spread,"" Yoon Tae-ho, a senior health official, said in a briefing.Health authorities are also on alert over looming infections at a hospital in southern Seoul.Since four nurses working at Samsung Medical Center, one of the country's five major general hospitals, were confirmed to be infected, health authorities have conducted tests on 1,418 people. No additional infections traced to the hospital were reported, but health authorities are conducting an epidemiological survey on two virus patients who came in contact with one of the infected nurses.The KCDC said more related cases are likely to spring up, as transmission routes are still unknown.It said Wednesday the nurses may have been infected at shared spaces, such as changing rooms, in the hospital or through patients undergoing surgery.The agency said it has yet to find a link between their cases and those tied to nightclubs.Health authorities remain on alert over further community spread, as more schools are set to reopen after high school seniors began to return to schools Wednesday.Incheon, west of Seoul, and Anseong, south of the capital, ordered third graders at 75 high schools to return home on Wednesday. Two high school students tested positive for COVID-19 in Incheon in cases related to the Itaewon cluster.Earlier in the day, a high school in the southeastern city of Daegu, once the epicenter of the virus outbreak here, was closed as a third grader who used a school dormitory was infected.Seoul's southwestern Yangcheon Ward is considering delaying the reopening of at least three elementary schools set for May 27 due to a church-related case in the district.The country, meanwhile, added two imported cases and reported one additional death, raising the total death toll to 264. The fatality rate was 2.37 percent.The total number of people released from quarantine after full recoveries stood at 10,135, up 69 from the previous day.Since Jan. 3, the country, with a population of more than 50 million, has carried out 788,684 tests, including 12,251 the previous day.

The figure includes six products that have won approval for emergency use locally.Buoyed by surging demand from abroad, several test kit makers have already clinched more orders this year than last year's total.Sugentech Inc. has signed 60 billion won ($49 million) worth of deals to export coronavirus test kits since April 1, which dwarfs its 2019 sales of 3.8 billion won.In April alone, the company shipped test kits worth 10 billion won, and it has been producing 2 million kits per week this month.Sugentech has secured deals to export kits that will be produced by June, a company official said, adding shipments will likely increase further in the second quarter of the year.Another industry player, Seegene. Inc., said its first-quarter sales came to 70 percent of its revenue for all of 2019, with operating and net profits already exceeding those of last year. The company did not provide exact figures.So far, Seegene has exported kits capable of conducting 20 million tests to 60 countries. The company recently inked a deal to export test kits to Brazil through a body under the World Health Organization and expected more exports in the coming months.Bioneer Corp. has also signed a deal to export COVID-19 test kits and related equipment worth 6.8 billion won to Indonesia. Bioneer, which saw its first-quarter sales surge 1.9 times from a year ago, struck deals to supply test kits to Gabon and Lebannon in April.Export figures are a testament to high overseas demand for South Korean test kits. The value of test kit exports came to $201.2 million in April, a more than eightfold jump from $24 million in March, according to the data from the Korea Customs Service.In the first four months of this year, South Korea exported $225 million worth of coronavirus test kits to a total of 103 nations.

"32","2020-05-21","The Korea Herald","[Noah Smith] Debt isn’t as scary as government bungling","Bloomberg","http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200520000188&ACE_SEARCH=1","  The coronavirus pandemic and the resulting economic depression are going to require huge amounts of government spending. The US government is devoting resources to halting the outbreak. It’s sustaining businesses during shutdowns so that they don’t have to be rebuilt from scratch. It’s paying the bills for workers who’ve lost their jobs. It’s bailing out state and local governments whose tax revenues are disappearing and can’t finance budget deficits. And it’s taking on much of the debt from the financial system to ensure that a banking crisis doesn’t follow the pandemic.All of these efforts are necessary. But add them all up, and they’re going to leave the US federal government with a lot of debt.Republicans have so far been willing to support big spending, but rumblings of worry are now starting. Experts are not quite sure what to think of the huge rise in debt, but some are beginning to pay attention. So what’s the problem with debt? There’s no immediate worry that the government will be forced into a default. Long-term interest rates are very low, in both real and nominal terms.That means that the US government is now effectively getting paid to borrow at long maturities. By doing a lot of deficit spending now, it can lock in those low interest rates for decades.The problem is what happens if there’s a need for future deficit spending. If private investors decide in 2022 or 2030 that the US debt is too large and stop buying Treasuries, the government will have a choice. It can let interest rates rise, meaning that future borrowing will incur higher interest costs. Or it can use the Federal Reserve to hold down long-term rates by buying Treasuries.The latter course of action would seem to be the more sensible one because rising interest rates would consume increasing amounts of the government’s budget, and could eventually force a default. But Fed actions that held down long-term rates in perpetuity -- which effectively becomes monetary financing of fiscal spending -- would incur the danger of hyperinflation.Talking about hyperinflation might seem crazy at a time when inflation is plunging. But it’s worth thinking about what hyperinflation would entail. It would result in a loss of confidence in the US as a country; investors would have to believe that US policy and the US economic system are in a long-term state of decline, and decide to abandon dollar-denominated assets. It would lead to the largest and most destructive episode of capital flight that the world has ever seen. Assuming China continued to resist the free movement of capital, most of the money would probably go to Europe and developed regions of East Asia. The global economic system would be devastated and utterly rearranged.Just a few months ago, a collapse of confidence in the US would have been unthinkable. It’s still highly unlikely. But the ineptitude with which the US has handled the pandemic is probably giving rise to the first glimmers of doubt.Among developed nations, the US has been uniquely incapable of suppressing COVID-19. The number of cases per capita is higher than that of any major developed nation except Spain (and that gap is closing). The rate of decline of cases and deaths from the peak is slower than any other rich country, and considerably slower than that of Europe as a whole.A number of highly visible policy mistakes and industrial deficiencies have contributed to this mess. The US failed to ramp up testing quickly, thanks to lack of federal leadership, regulatory blunders and fragmentation of supply chains. US stay-at-home orders, implemented haphazardly at the state level, were less effective in halting the spread of the virus than in most other developed countries. Now, several states are reopening prematurely, ignoring the guidelines set forth by the federal government. The president is egging them on.Meanwhile, the Michigan legislature has had to cancel a legislative session out of fear of armed protesters, suggesting the beginning of a breakdown in law and order. There are even questions about whether the Donald Trump administration may try to delay the fall presidential election or cast doubt on the legitimacy of the result. Meanwhile, both Democrats and Republicans seem convinced that the leaders of the opposite party are criminals. All of these developments could indicate that the US is less politically stable than many assume.If investors begin to have doubts about the US’s long-term efficacy and stability as a nation, it could make the nation’s growing mountain of debt harder to sustain in the future, raising the risk of a catastrophic capital outflow. But the way to allay the danger is not to engage in fiscal austerity; that will merely make the depression worse, and contribute to greater unrest and instability. Instead, the US needs to improve its public health system and its industrial supply chains, while backing off of the politics of brinksmanship. Reassuring the world that the US will remain a developed nation will make debt less of a problem -- not the other way around.Noah SmithNoah Smith is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

To achieve the ambitious vision, he pledged to push for what he described as the Korean version of the New Deal, which will focus on a future-oriented preemptive investment designed to establish digital infrastructure and create more jobs.It will take concrete and swift actions, not any additional rhetoric, to prove he is really serious about revitalizing the country’s economy, which was already faltering before the novel coronavirus outbreak.The Moon government should accelerate efforts to forge a more corporate-friendly environment. It needs to abandon or readjust ill-conceived policies that have dampened corporate activity and are now hampering local businesses from coping with difficulties caused by COVID-19.The first and foremost thing that should be redressed is the rigid implementation of the shortened workweek.The country’s labor act was amended in February 2018, reducing the maximum weekly working hours to 52 from 68.The reduced workweek came into force for companies with 300 or more employees in July last year. At the outset of this year, it became applicable to small and medium-sized enterprises with 50 to 299 workers. All companies in the nation will have to comply with the revised rules beginning in July next year.Flaws in the shortened workweek system were dramatically revealed earlier this year when local face mask makers could not increase production to meet demand amid the spread of the coronavirus. At the time, the government exempted them from the workweek rules.Research and development work in the materials and equipment industries was exempted from the rules last year after Japan imposed curbs on the export of some high-tech items to Korea. But the government remains opposed to similar exemptions for other sectors.It is inefficient and unreasonable for the government to make case-by-case decisions on whether to grant exemptions from the workweek rules.Easing the rigid workweek system is essential to carry out the Korean version of the New Deal.In his speech on May 10, Moon said his government would strive to turn the country into a “digital powerhouse” with innovative business ventures and startups serving as the main driving force. Held back by the inflexible workweek system, local innovative businesses could hardly hope to realize their potential and move ahead of their competitors from other major advanced economies.A more flexible workweek system is also needed to bring home Korean manufacturing firms running factories abroad.The Moon government is stepping up efforts to induce more local manufacturers to transfer their overseas production back to the country. Under consideration are measures to help finance the cost of reshoring, offer tax incentives and subsidies and ease regulations on building factories in the Seoul metropolitan area.But most companies cite the shortened workweek and other excessive labor regulations as the main reasons they hesitate to return home. They are particularly concerned that such restraints would make it difficult to deal with overseas orders by the delivery deadline.A fundamental way to cushion the negative effects of the shortened workweek system is to revise the law to expand an existing provision on the flexible application of the rules. It allows for adjusting the maximum working hours to 52 on average within a certain period by letting employees work longer during busy times and later go on deferred leave.The local business community has called for such flexibility to be built into the system on a yearly basis instead of the current three months.Parliamentary deliberation on a bill aimed at expanding flexibility for employers has stalled for more than a year, as the liberal ruling Democratic Party of Korea remains passive amid objections from labor organizations.The ruling party, which secured a dominant majority in last month’s parliamentary election, should be more active in enacting the measure when the next National Assembly begins its four-year term late this month.President Moon needs to come forward to persuade ruling party lawmakers and labor organizations to accept the flexible application of the workweek system. Doing so would prove the sincerity of his pledge to make the country’s economy fit for the post-coronavirus era."

The Seoul City-funded orchestra had been looking into getting its 95 players tested for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 before rehearsals begin for the May 29 concert at the Seoul Arts Center, as it was considering to performing the upcoming concert in front of an audience. For the concert, the orchestra’s Music Director Osmo Vanska, who traveled here from the US for the concert, has been in self-quarantine in Seoul since his arrival.However, the state-funded orchestra announced late Wednesday, the concert has been canceled as a preventive measure against the virus spread. “Though the SPO was looking into putting on an onstage performance in front of the audience as South Korea’s ‘social distancing’ policy eased to ‘everyday life quarantine,’ community spread continues to occur, such as the hospital virus outbreak and the increase of infections linked to Itaewon clubs,” the announcement from the SPO read.“In a situation where various risk factors exist, the SPO deemed that cancellation is the best choice to protect the health and safety of the players and audience.”If the SPO’s original plan had worked out, the May 29 concert would have been the first orchestral performance onstage with an actual audience in the pandemic era, raising the curtain on the global performing arts scene. “Perhaps, it is the time for the ‘new normal’ and the SPO could forge the path,” SPO CEO Kang Eun-kyung had told The Korea Herald on Wednesday morning, before the concert was officially canceled, observing that the whole performing arts scene has been at a standstill over the past several months. “The orchestra members and the audience may feel uncomfortable about being in an enclosed space with others (out of concern about the virus spreading). So we are looking into the possibility (of having our members undergo virus tests) before the first rehearsal takes place,” she had said, adding that the SPO was seeking medical advice regarding the plan. The SPO said, instead of the canceled concert, it will prepare for a no-audience, online concert under the baton of Music Director Osmo Vanska on the same day.The SPO originally planned to present Vaughan Williams’ Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis for String Orchestra, Hindemith’s Symphonic Metamorphosis of Themes by Carl Maria von Weber, Elgar’s Variations on an Original Theme Enigma, Op. 36, and Stravinsky’s Symphonies of Wind Instruments at the May 29 concert, titled “Old Tunes, New Worlds.”By Im Eun-byel (silverstar@heraldcorp.com)"

But now we know we have a safe system -- everyone has to test negative twice before they are released at the end of the isolation period.”He said that in times of crisis, the government must communicate transparently and inform the public accurately to “not let fear take hold,” and that once he explained the stakes, Jincheon and Asan residents showed “amazing tolerance.”Since the first case was reported on Jan. 20, the Health Ministry and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have held daily coronavirus briefings except for the parliamentary election day on April 15.Kim, who represents Korea at the World Health Organization as part of the executive board, said the coronavirus has proven health security cannot be sustained by individual countries alone in an interconnected world.“A health crisis in one region can easily travel across borders, which is why cooperation and solidarity are critical in securing global health against emerging dangers,” he said.Speaking about the government’s post-coronavirus ventures, Kim said one of the most imperative tasks was giving the KCDC more autonomy.“There could be another public health emergency after the coronavirus and preparations have to start early to avoid future stumbles,” he said.Some changes have to come in terms of our work culture, too.The disease control agency’s recommendations for taking three to four days of leave when feeling unwell to stem the spread in communities was hard for him to follow, the vice minister admitted.“All my life, I’ve been taught to believe showing up for work and not missing a day whether sick or healthy was a virtue. This is something that has to change for our own health and safety of those around us.”By Kim Arin (arin@heraldcorp.com) "

The Korean stock allocation is expected to reduce to 15 percent of the entire assets by 2025, from some 20 percent as of end-2019. NPS, the world’s third-largest pension fund, has logged 11.31 percent rate of return annually. The figure is the highest since the inception of NPS Investment Management Committee in 1999. But due to the coronavirus fallout, NPS has sought to decrease its stock exposure this year. From January to February, its Korean stock holdings shrank by some 10 trillion won, while its foreign stock exposure shed over 4 trillion won, according to the latest data. Its Korean stocks took a 7.8 percent loss if combined over the cited period, while those of foreign stocks dropped 3 percent. But the increase in fixed-income assets and alternative investments have offset the decline in stock holdings, leading to a 0.1 percent uptick of its assets under management, data also showed. “The coronavirus impact on the financial market is stabilizing, but the long-term macroeconomic view is still unpredictable,” Park said in his keynote speech during the committee meeting. “(NPS) will pursue stable returns on its investment as a long-term investor.”By Son Ji-hyoung (consnow@heraldcorp.com)"

KRICT aims to license out the platform technology for vaccine development. Kim said that the KRICT’s goal is to create a better vaccine, not the first vaccine.“Social distancing was more effective in curbing the COVID-19 spread than quick diagnosis,” said Lee Hyo-jung, senior researcher from the National Institute of Mathematical Sciences.“Had the students returned to school as originally planned on April 6, new cases of COVID-19 infections would have continued till July,” Lee said, citing the NIMS’s research using stochastic metapopulation simulation based on population mobility volume in Daegu, Busan, Seoul and Gyeonggi Province -- surmised from individuals’ mobile data usage.Lee said research is continuously being validated over time. Using the same mathematical model, the team was able to predict that the peak of COVID-19 infection in Daegu will be in early March, after which the regional epidemic will subside as a result of governmental countermeasures if not for unforeseen cluster outbreaks.Professor Ki Mo-ran from National Cancer Center, pointed out that mathematical models employed by global institutions yielded various different outcomes, and to draw the full picture one must look at more than one model for comparison. Ki counted Korea, Germany and Taiwan as the three countries that have so far successfully contained the coronavirus outbreak. She cautioned, however, that in the case of Korea’s latest Itaewon nightclub cluster, should the infected patients act reluctant to come forward, the number of patients may remain unchanged in the beginning but experience a spike in two weeks’ time. It would take at least 25 days for the spread to slow down to less than 10 people per day in this case, she said.Professor Yeom Joon-sup, an infectious disease specialist at Yonsei Univesity College of Medicine and professor Lee Jae-gap of Hallym University Medical Center said COVID-19 has been an impetus for regulatory changes in wearable medical hardware and software for epidemic intelligence framework. Global surveillance system for influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory infections are being rewritten to accommodate the COVID-19, while new apps such as KoEID provide an arena for doctors to exchange breaking information on clinical cases and research, Lee said.Advancements are also taking place in the field of test kits and protective hazmat suits -- topics which were also discussed at the symposium.By Lim Jeong-yeo (kaylalim@heraldcorp.com)"
"41","2020-05-20","The Korea Herald","[Herald Interview] ‘Startups, SMEs hold key to Korea’s future’","Shin Ji-hye","http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200520000890&ACE_SEARCH=1","  Since Minister Park Young-sun took the helm of South Korea’s SMEs and Startups Ministry in April 2019, a lot has happened. For one, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to pummel all industries worldwide, and most devastatingly, smaller businesses.At this juncture, Park may be the most suitable representative voice supporting startups and small and medium-sized enterprises, with her expansive journalistic and political career driven by her support for the principle of balanced economic growth. And she has never been one to shy away from pushing her convictions.Since taking office, Park has been in the vanguard of one of key tasks of the Moon Jae-in administration -- to revitalize SMEs, which account for more than 90 percent of the jobs and 99 percent of all companies here. In the post-coronavirus era, Park said she was confident that Korean startups and SMEs will play a pivotal role in a new, digital economy. And the ministry will help them to scale up in global markets, Park stressed in an interview with The Korea Herald on Thursday. Explaining that she had just participated in a meeting between President Moon Jae-in and young leaders selected by Forbes Under 30 Asia, Park candidly expressed her fascination for the future of budding enterprises.“I was quite impressed with their innovative business ideas. They did not hesitate to make suggestions to the president, not to mention asking questions that hit the core. I could feel how the world was changing through their questions. What we aim to do is to discover such promising firms and help them scale up.”Since the inauguration of the Moon administration, the Small and Medium Business Administration was elevated to the status of a ministry in June 2017. Park is the second minister to serve since.“(As the minister) what I’m proudest of is that startups had the highest investment ever last year. This is the most active growth area since the Moon government took office.” In 2019, investment in startups reached 4.3 trillion won ($3.4 billion), renewing its all-time high, and five unicorns -- startups with a value of over 1 trillion won -- were created.“The digital economy is an inevitable global trend, and we need to be prepared for it. That can be possible through innovative startups. ... In the face of the pandemic, I saw many firms turn the crisis into an opportunity, by creating non-contact services, coronavirus maps, mask maps and diagnostic kits.”Such innovative digital firms will be “the backbone that will support the Korean version of the New Deal,” she said. The New Deal policy was announced by Moon last month to create jobs and booth growth, focusing on digital infrastructure, non-contact industries and digitalization of social overhead capital. Park was a journalist at MBC for 22 years. She entered politics in 2004 as a spokesperson for the then-ruling Uri Party and the same year was elected as the 17th member of the National Assembly. In the Democratic Party, she served as chief policymaker and supreme council member and floor leader. She has helped President Moon as co-chief of his election campaign. Before she was tapped to lead the SME Ministry, Park was the first woman to chair the Legislation and Judiciary Committee.Park has been known as an avid patron of startups, by serving her three legislative terms representing Guro-gu, home to Seoul’s largest digital complexes where startups and small companies are concentrated. She also played a leading role in passing bills related to economic democratization, such as expanding punitive damages and regulating work when she was the chairperson of the judiciary committee in 2013. Since leading the ministry, Park has initiated a voluntary win-win cooperation project to connect smaller businesses with conglomerates. She has also pushed the “Brand K” campaign to help SMEs expand overseas. Below are excerpts from the interview. The Korea Herald: What do you think is the biggest hurdle that Korean startups and SMEs face in going global?Park Young-sun: Until now, many companies started their businesses only targeting the domestic market, with the view that they could go global when the business is successful here first. They think the local market of 50 million population is a stable market. But once they try to go global after having a presence here, it is too late. Businesses should target the global market from the start. Gladly, I am seeing more promising startups recently. They are startups like Qanda, Classting and Laundrygo. Qanda, a free math solution app using artificial intelligence that has now secured around 8 million subscribers worldwide. Classting, a learning content that connects teachers, students and parents to communicate, is now provided in 25 countries in 15 different languages. Laundrygo, a laundry service using Bluetooth-connected laundry collection box, has applied for patents for its business model in the US and China.KH: Brand K is still in its beginning stage to become known worldwide. Please introduce it.Park: It’s like the Swiss Label certification mark. The government recognizes that the products are of high quality, reasonably priced and reliable. In September last year, the first batch of 38 products was labeled with Brand K and it worked. Since the certification, their combined exports rose 114 billion won to 1.5 trillion won in the September-December period on-year. The second batch of 81 products was labeled with Brand K in April this year. They include Vitamin C brand Lemona, whose sales surged after K-pop powerhouse BTS endorsed, and diagnostic kits exported to more than 100 nations amid the pandemic. Although the names of the diagnostic kit companies were little known overseas, users trusted the products as the Korean government recognizes them. KH: What do you think are the key competitive features of Korean startups and SMEs?Park: Korea has the characteristics of innovation, speed and customer orientation with a high-level technology. There are also many small and medium-sized enterprises that have the ability to read global trends quickly, adapt to changing situations and produce innovative products which are the world’s first.KH: Global investment, mergers and exit are required for startups and SMEs to advance into overseas markets. How can the ministry help?Park: We will strengthen global cooperation to expand opportunities for startups to advance into global markets and attract foreign capital.In order to attract foreign capital, the ministry has established and operated a global fund worth about 3 trillion won in cooperation with foreign venture capitalists since 2013. We will continue to collaborate with global venture capitalists.By Shin Ji-hye (shinjh@heraldcorp.com)"

But there have since been calls from the international community and civic groups here to include programs to tackle climate change as well, according to Cheong Wa Dae spokesman Kang Min-seok.Recently, the president received a written report of the feasibility from four ministries involved.

The country's corporate tax revenue rose in the past five years to 72 trillion won ($59 billion) in 2019 from 45 trillion won in 2015, according to the Korea Economic Research Institute (KERI). This year, however, corporate tax revenue could reach an estimated 56.5 trillion won, 12 percent lower than the government's projection of 64.4 trillion won, KERI said in a statement.  ""This year's corporate tax revenue is set to decline further as companies are expected to suffer weaker demand amid virus woes in the first half and to pay decreased corporate taxes for their first-half performance in August,"" a KERI official said.In March, companies paid corporate income taxes for their business performance in 2019. The corporate tax revenue collected in March stood at 13.4 trillion won, the statement said.   Chipmakers, carmakers and airlines have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic since March, which led to poor earnings results in the first quarter. In the first quarter, the country's overall tax revenue fell 11 percent on-year to 69.5 trillion won from 78 trillion won. In contrast with the declining tax revenue, the government's spending is on the rise to shore up the economy through a variety of stimulus packages. The government's 2020 budget came to 512.3 trillion won.Earlier this year, the parliament passed two rounds of supplementary budgets worth 23.9 trillion won mainly to help minimize the economic fallout of the coronavirus and provide emergency handouts for all households.The finance ministry plans to spend more than 60 percent of the state budget in the first half and is considering further cuts to other planned spending to fund another round of extra spending to tackle the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. The government's aggressive push for spending raises concerns that it may suffer a wider fiscal deficit for this year. In the January-March period, the government already reported a record quarterly fiscal deficit of 55.3 trillion won since it began to compile the data in 2003.     The country reported 54.4 trillion won in fiscal deficit for the whole of 2018 compared with 10.6 trillion won the previous year, the ministry said.

We’d prefer that we wrapped this up several months ago, but both sides are committed to make this happen,” Marc Knapper, deputy assistant secretary of state for Korea and Japan, said via video conferencing during a forum hosted by the Korea Press Foundation and East-West Center in Seoul. “Both of our leaders are fully engaged on this. …But as allies, we are both compelled to find a way forward and we will find a way forward, and I am very confident of that,” he said. Despite seven rounds of talks since September toward renewal of the Special Measures Agreement, the pact that governs the upkeep of the roughly 28,500-strong US Forces Korea, the two sides failed to clinch a deal, largely due to differences over the amount that Seoul should pay. They were close to reaching an agreement, until US President Donald Trump rejected what Seoul called its “best offer” of 13 percent hike from last year’s SMA of around 1.04 trillion won ($846 million). The US has asked Seoul to pay around $1.3 billion a year -- an increase of about 50 percent from the previous year. On such a “Trump factor” affecting the outcome of the deal, Knapper stressed the president’s stance of “fair share of burden” with American allies, that could give less burden on the US taxpayers. “Trump has made it very clear, and he made this very clear during his election campaign that he wanted, working with our allies, to figure out the way to have a fair share of burden among allies, such as South Korea, and others, whether in Northeast Asia or Europe, to lessen the burden on American taxpayers,” he said. “So that’s what we are doing,” he said. “We wanted to do it in a way that’s respectful and we want to do it in a way that’s hopefully not too public, but that ultimately will benefit the alliance, and strengthen our abilities as allies and ultimately will ensure we got a fair share of burden between our countries.”Ko Yun-ju, director-general for North American affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reiterated South Korea’s stance that the cost-sharing should be “reasonable and fair.”“It is undesirable for this impasse to last long,” said Ko. “At this time, the negotiators are continuing to discuss over phone and email. I think it’s important for both the sides to reach a landing zone that could be agreed mutually.” Ko added the both the sides agree that the deal needs to be reached within this year. Despite not able to reach an accord, the two sides stressed that the alliance is stronger than ever with expanded economic cooperation and in response to coronavirus. “In comparison to any other administration, the conversation between the two heads of state and high-level officials are taking place better than any other time,” said Ko. “In a critical situation of COVID-19, the two countries’ joint responses are from our partnership.” “One discovers the quality of an alliance during a crisis, and I think during this pandemic, we really discovered how deep and broad and trustful the US-ROK relationship is,” said Knapper, citing test kits and mask provisions by Korea, as well as information sharing and economic cooperation on COVID-19 outbreak. “I think lot of this is thanks to high-level communication and cooperation we enjoyed and lot of it is also due to the long history of the two countries in terms of health cooperation.”In regards to stalled denuclearization talks between US and North Korea, Knapper declined to speculate what Pyongyang’s intentions are, but stressed Washington’s stance on upholding the 2018 Singapore declaration between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. “What I will say is the US policy right now is to leave the door open to diplomacy and that we remain committed to our efforts that began in Singapore, continued through Hanoi and through several other lower-level meetings,” he said. “Our goal remains to fulfill the spirit of the Singapore declaration, which includes dismantling the North’s nuclear program and missile program but also bringing peace to the peninsula to transforming the US-North Korea relationships.”By Ahn Sung-mi (sahn@heraldcorp.com)"
