Foreigners refusing to accept the two-week self-isolation are denied entry to the country, while rule violators are fined and deported.With the additions of the five, a total of 17 foreign nationals have been deported for breaching self-isolation rules. Including those penalized for refusing to accept self-isolation, 24 foreigners have so far been deported.The ministry said nine other foreigners have been caught violating self-isolation rules unintentionally and were allowed to stay in the country after paying fines due to their low risk of spreading coronavirus.According to the ministry, the deported Pakistani tested positive for COVID-19 after inviting friends to his self-isolation place for dinner on April 27, one day after he arrived here.One Chinese national was caught escaping from a self-isolation place 11 times from April 14-28, each time after leaving his or her mobile phone behind to avoid being tracked.Another Chinese national was accused of leaving a self-isolation place for 11 minutes on April 23 for a smoke. The person was also criticized for hindering self-isolation monitoring by intentionally hanging up or avoiding calls from civil servants.The Polish national entered here March 10 and was ordered to self-isolate after one of the person's acquaintances contracted coronavirus. But the European took a walk in a public park almost every day from March 13 before testing positive on March 26. The authorities issued a departure order for the Polish national, instead of deportation, as the person had personally paid his or her own medical bill totaling 21 million won ($17,000).The British national was deported after being caught visiting a screen golf room one day after taking a coronavirus test on March 23 without wearing a face mask.

The third extra budget, estimated to be around 40 trillion won, is set to be unveiled in early June, mainly to boost investment in the local sectors and the job market. Regarding the progress of the government’s relief handout program, Kim said 84.3 percent of around 21.7 million households here applied and received support as of Friday. Of them, around 2.8 million households were categorized as low-income households and 99.9 percent of them have so far received the handouts. Since last week, South Korea started handing out cash to most households here for its relief handout program. One million won is handed out to households with four or more people, while those with fewer family members receive a minimum of 400,000 won. South Korea has so far pledged coronavirus relief packages worth some 240 trillion won to provide a cushion for companies and economies hit by the pandemic. The export-reliant nation’s economy shrank 1.4 percent on-quarter in the first quarter, marking the sharpest quarterly contraction since the last quarter of 2008, when it was hit by the global financial crisis.

The recent pandemic has prompted a lock-down in India, a major pharmaceuticals ingredient supplier for global chemical pharma firms. The factories in India are running at a 30 percent lower operation rate than usual, leading to development hurdles for competitors pursuing HIV treatments, according to Celltrion Pharm.Seizing this as an opportunity, the company will equip its Cheongju plant with exclusive manufacturing lines for CT-G7.It has sufficient raw materials to make the pharmaceutical and is suffering no setbacks from the business slowdown in India, a Celltrion Pharm official told The Korea Herald.CT-G7 is Celltrion’s independently developed HIV treatment that has gained tentative approval from the US’ Food and Drug Administration in April.The global market for HIV treatments as of 2019 came up to around $1 billion Celltrion said, citing Clinton Health Access Initiative. Celltrion has set the goal of reaching 120 billion won ($100 million) in annual revenue, a 10 percent share of the global market for HIV drugs.

The exhibition, “2020 MMCA Asia Project: Looking for Another Family” looks into different forms of families, breaking away from the conventional definition of biological or martial relationships, showcasing 15 artworks from 15 artist teams across eight Asian countries: South Korea, Indonesia, Taiwan, Japan, Philippines, Hong Kong, Malaysia and China. The queer community, a marginalized community that has been a rare subject at the state-funded museum, is part of the exhibition shown through the artworks by Lee Kang-seung and Dew Kim from South Korea. Lee Kang-seung’s new project “Imaginaries of the Future” lets audiences explore “queering” at a lounge where drawings, books and videos on queer community coexist. Dew Kim explores the concept of “queerness” through the perspective of Shamanism, a religion associated with North Asia and was often denigrated as the “Black faith” by western culture. Kim titled his new project “The Old and Wrong Way of Seeing Things,” borrowing a derogatory description of Shamanism. The exhibition, which opened public on Friday, will run until Aug. 23 at MMCA Seoul venue. Visitors are required to make a reservation online through the MMCA website as the number of visitors are limited due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The exhibition is part of MMCA’s Asia Project that started in 2018 to explore Asian contemporary art. “2020 MMCA Asia Project: Looking for Another Family,” is the second edition of the project after the exhibition “How Little You Know About Me” in August 2018. “’Looking For Another Family’ is an opportunity to introduce the diversity and dynamicity of Asian contemporary art to Korean and overseas audiences,” said Youn Bummo, director of the MMCA. “At this time of COVID-19 pandemic, the innovative works of the Asian artist in this exhibition and their collaboration will hopefully propagate the spirit of social solidarity and coexistence to the world.” By Park Yuna  (yunapark@heraldcorp.com)"

The branches include the group's headquarters in Gwacheon, just south of Seoul, and facilities in the cities of Busan, Gwangju and Daejeon.The raid marks the prosecution's first forcible investigation into the group since February when a group of people who claimed to be victims of the religious group filed a complaint against the 89-year-old Lee for embezzlement, dereliction of duty and violation of infectious disease prevention laws.The prosecution was seen as taking a cautious approach in investigating in the face of mounting public pressure. It was believed that too tough an investigation might drive the sect's members to hide out, impeding the government's fight against the coronavirus.As new infection cases have dwindled to a trickle, it is now considered to be safer than at the early stages of the pandemic to make a push to finish up the investigation.The Shincheonji sect is accused of causing the country's biggest cluster outbreaks, accounting for some 47 percent of the country's total caseload of 11,142. Its worship services, where members sit close together and chant loud in poorly ventilated spaces, are believed to have been a factor in the rapid spread the virus. Also, Lee is accused of ordering group members not to fully cooperate with health officials, thus hindering state efforts to contain COVID-19 in the early stages of the pandemic.On March 2, two days after the prosecutors launched an investigation into the leader, he appeared in front of live television cameras to make a deep bow and apologize for ""unintentionally"" spreading the virus.The Seoul Metropolitan Government said the previous day that it had filed a suit against Lee and other Shincheonji leaders on charges of homicide and inflicting injury.Earlier, the municipal government of Daegu also took legal action against the sect for hindering the government-led disease-control efforts by providing false information.

""Both market leader LG Electronics and Sony have revised down their shipment targets for OLED TVs this year.""Industry insiders said that production delay from LG Display Co., the sole large-size OLED TV panel supplier in the world, will weigh down the industry. LG Display previously planned to have its OLED panel factory in Guangzhou, China, start mass production in the first quarter of the year, but it could not meet the schedule due to COVID-19 outbreak.The company recently said it plans to fully operate the Guangzhou factory within the first half of the year.  Industry observers said a sharp rise of QLED TVs can further limit OLED TV sales amid the pandemic. ""Aside from the pandemic-induced slowdown in OLED demand, the more flexible pricing of QLED products will also represent a substantial threat to the sales of OLED TVs this year, since the latter have historically maintained a high retail price,"" WitsView said. The global QLED TV shipment is expected to grow 41.8 percent on-year to reach 8.27 million units this year with aggressive sales promotions from the market leader Samsung Electronics Co., according to WitsView.QLED is Samsung's marketing term for its liquid crystal display (LCD) TVs using quantum-dot technology to enhance performance in key picture quality areas. Although overall global TV shipment is expected to suffer 5.8 percent on-year decline to 205.21 million units this year, WitsView said QLED TV sales can increase further.  ""In spite of the downturn in global TV shipment this year, the market for QLED products thrived on the flourishing stay-at-home economy as well as the sales promotions of Samsung Visual Display's older models in the first quarter of 2020, which resulted in retail price cuts of more than 20 percent for 65-inch QLED TVs in the North American market, incidentally creating a wave of replacement demand for new TV sets,"" it said. According to market tracker Omdia, Samsung was the top TV vendor in the January-March period as it accounted for 32.4 percent of the global TV market in terms of sales value. (Yonhap)"

This week, the impact is likely to be larger,"" KCD chief Kim Dong-ho said.An average of their revenues last week surpassed those tallied the previous year in areas such as Gyeonggi Province that surrounds Seoul and South Gyeongsang Province.The southeastern city of Daegu, once the epicenter of the virus outbreak here, and Seoul, meanwhile, saw small merchants' sales almost recover to last year's level, the data showed.The South Korean economy shrank 1.4 percent on-quarter in the first quarter as the coronavirus outbreak dented consumer spending and exports. Private consumption declined 6.4 percent on-quarter in the cited period.South Koreans are using the relief funds at various locations ranging from small supermarkets, restaurants and beauty salons to traditional markets.According to data compiled by three major convenient stores, demand for daily necessities and goods that are relatively expensive at such outlets increased after the government handed out the relief funds.Sales of fruit, vegetables and foodstuff rose an average of 15 percent over last weekend from a week earlier, according to the convenience store chain CU. Sales of wine logged the fastest growth of 23.3 percent among liquors.""Smaller merchants and the self-employed are expected to see an improvement in business on the back of slowed virus spread and the emergency payout,"" the Ministry of SMEs and Startups said in a statement.

As of noon, 215 infections were connected to the case.To avoid a second wave of infections, South Korea has been carrying out more than 77,000 tests on those who visited affected clubs between April 24 and May 6. South Korea has not yet identified the origin of the virus that struck Itaewon, although health authorities assume it came from either North America or Europe. The number of imported cases rose by nine from a day earlier, reaching 1,200. More than 88 percent of such patients were South Korean nationals returning from overseas.Authorities said the country is expected to experience a gradual increase in the number of imported cases, as it is inevitable for South Korea to maintain at least limited exchanges with other countries.The fatality rate came to 2.37 percent. South Korea has not yet reported any deaths from patients aged 29 and younger. It has also not yet seen a coronavirus-related syndrome among children as observed overseas. The total number of people released from quarantine after full recoveries stood at 10,162, up 27 from the previous day. The latest figures indicate that more than 90 percent of confirmed patients have fully recovered from the virus.South Korea has carried out tests on 802,418 people since Jan. 3, including 13,734 from a day earlier.The health authorities say they remain vigilant over sporadic group infections across the nation, though they say it is safe to deem the club-linked cases as now being under control.""The cases from Itaewon did not lead to a massive proliferation of the virus, but we are still experiencing local infections in the Seoul metropolitan area,"" Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip said during a daily briefing, hinting that karaoke rooms, PC cafes and bars are still among places vulnerable to the virus. Earlier this week, four nurses at Samsung Medical Center, one of the country's five major general hospitals, tested positive.Exactly how they became infected with the COVID-19 virus was not immediately known, but authorities say they have not found connections to the clubgoers.Dozens of high schools in Gyeonggi Province that surrounds Seoul ordered students to return home on Wednesday. Two high school students tested positive for COVID-19 in Incheon, in what could be infections tied to Itaewon.Another vocational school, in Daegu, once the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea, also closed down on Thursday after a student in a dormitory tested positive. A family member of the student was also infected, although other school workers and students tested negative. South Korea, which normally starts the new school year in March, allowed high school seniors to return to classrooms on Wednesday, with a goal of having students of other grades gradually resume normal routines by early June.Nine infections were also reported from a buffet located in Bucheon, just west of Seoul. Health authorities said they are currently working to draw up new guidelines for students, as the upcoming summer heat is anticipated to make it more difficult for them to wear masks at all times.""The COVID-19 pandemic can never be eradicated unless there's a vaccine,"" Kim added. ""We will continue to experience sporadic infections in different corners of our daily lives.""The vice minister, however, said South Korea can nevertheless curb the pandemic if people continue to follow basic sanitary guidelines.KCDC Director Jeong Eun-kyeong especially warned that South Koreans in their 20s should be more concerned about the COVID-19 pandemic, as the patients in the age group may not show any symptoms and yet infect other vulnerable groups.More than 40 percent of some 335 virus cases reported since May 6 were from those in their 20s, according to health authorities.""We understand that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a lot of stress for young South Koreans, who faced troubles in continuing their studies and job searches amid the social-distancing plan,"" Jeong said.

We need it more than ever","Kim Hoo-ran","http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200521000640&ACE_SEARCH=1","  Months into the COVID-19 pandemic, life seems to have settled into a humdrum rhythm. Days pass like the swing of a pendulum -- back and forth, back and forth, from home to work, work to home. Yet, such regularity as I have not experienced in years does little to offer peace of mind or comfort. Beneath the surface calm is the constant whirring of the brain. Actions have consequences and in these perilous times, we are required to constantly make decisions that could potentially impact not only our own safety, but that of those closest to us -- family, friends and colleagues. If strict social distancing had made me feel relatively safe, the more relaxed social distancing now in place has made me more anxious. With the former, I was without choices; the latter means I need to make decisions based the perceived level of danger.Do I accept an invitation to a large dinner gathering of people that I do not know, where masks will be taken off to eat and drink? Am I putting myself at unnecessary risk by requesting an interview be held at a hospital where COVID-19 patients are being treated? Weighing the pros and cons of my plans can go on and on, and I admit I have lost sleep over them on many nights.And there is little respite from a brain on an overdrive, not even in one’s dreams. People around the world have reported having strange dreams in the time of the new coronavirus. On a recent night, I woke up in panic from a dream in which two burly security guards were approaching me as I sat on a church pew. Even in the dream, I felt the terror of having forgotten to wear a mask and realizing that the guards were about to grab me by the arms to escort me out. Mirth is in short supply these days. If listening to an episode of “All Creatures Great and Small” can make me break into a fit of hearty laughter on a drive to work, I know I am willing myself to laugh at even the smallest thing, just so I can feel what it is like to laugh. If something can take my mind off all the doom and gloom being forecast about the post - COVID-19 pandemic world, I’d say I am game.I would like to be moved, my soul stirred, to be transported away from the time and space that I occupy, if only for a few minutes. As most concerts around the world have been canceled, performances have moved to online platforms. I was struck by the brilliance of pianist Sunwoo Yekwon who posted on Instagram clips of Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1 and Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No.2 performances, playing both the piano and the orchestral parts. Rock star Yoon Do-hyun has really embraced the online platform, performing live concerts almost daily. His online sessions stand out for their intimacy, where he makes the viewers feel like they are actually meeting and talking face-to-face. The sound quality does not matter too much at this point.Yet, online concerts cannot replace the thrill of sitting in the concert hall, eagerly anticipating what is about to unfold onstage. The emotional and physical connections between the performers and the audience are absent, making it difficult to stay engaged. One misses the visceral emotions brought on by feeling the notes against the skin, breathing the same air.Therein lies the difficulty. Breathing the same air without having it filtered through a mask is now a risky behavior. Hence, the cancellation Wednesday of next week’s scheduled Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra concert. If a full orchestra performing in a large concert hall is not going to be possible in the foreseeable future, orchestras should look into alternatives. Outdoor performances by smaller ensembles, playing to an audience sitting far apart could be considered. It may be a cliché to say music has the power to heal. But music does heal and healing is done best when there is a communion of souls. And these days, there are many that yearn healing.By Kim Hoo-ran (khooran@heraldcorp.com)--The writer is the culture desk editor at The Korea Herald – Ed."
"26","2020-05-22","The Korea Herald","[Robert J. Fouser] Dealing with labor market duality","Robert J. Fouser","http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200521000279&ACE_SEARCH=1","  South Korea continues its steady march back to normal life as the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic recedes. The nation continues to earn international praise for its effective response to the pandemic. As most nations begin to emerge from emergency measures, attention has turned to rebuilding economies reeling from lockdowns. Though Korea managed to escape lockdowns, deteriorating economic conditions are creating new challenges.In the first quarter of 2020, gross domestic product declined by an annual rate of 1.4 percent, the first decline since the fourth quarter of 2008. The International Monetary Fund projects that the economy will shrink 1.2 percent for the full year. That would make 2020 the first year of negative growth since the 5.1 percent decline in 1998.Other major nations fared much worse. China, where the pandemic first hit, saw its GDP fall by an unprecedented 6.8 percent, the first drop in decades. The US saw a sharp 4.8 percent decline and expects a much larger decline in the second quarter. Japan, meanwhile, is now officially in recession after GDP declined 3.4 percent in the first quarter of 2020 and 6.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019. The IMF projects that China will recover enough to achieve 1.2 percent growth for the 2020. The US will decline by 5.9 percent, the worst decline since the Great Depression in the 1930s. The eurozone will decline by 7.5 percent with Italy and Spain being particularly hard hit. Except for India, which will grow by 1.9 percent, other developing economies will see declines in GDP.These dire GDP numbers translate into millions of lost jobs and businesses, causing widespread hardship around the world. The World Bank recently estimated that the pandemic could push as many as 60 million people back into extreme poverty after years of decline. Nations are scrambling to implement policies to mitigate the worst of the economic damage.The Korean government has implemented a series of extra budgets containing direct payments to individuals, rescue packages for troubled businesses, and other measures to support the economy. The focus of the efforts has been to protect jobs to prevent the economy from spiraling downward.The interest in protecting jobs amid a crisis of this magnitude is understandable. Many other advanced nations have adopted similar policies to protect employment. The desire to protect jobs in Korea, however, shifts the focus away from long-standing problems caused by the dual labor market. A dual labor market is one with two tiers: regular and non-regular workers. Regular tier workers enjoy good wages, social benefits, and job security. Non-regular tier workers, by contrast, receive lower wages, few or no social benefits, and have low levels of job security. The two tiers overlap, and all economies have varying degrees of labor market duality.In Korea’s case, labor market duality is large. Data on OECD countries in 2018 covered three categories -- part-time employment, temporary employment, and self-employment --dominated by non-regular tier workers. At 12.2 percent, Korea was below the OECD average of part-time employment. Temporary employment in the country stood at 21.2 percent and self-employment at 25.1 percent, both of which were much higher than the OECD average.Definitions of different types of employment vary among nations, but the percentage of non-regular workers in Korea is clearly on the high end for developed countries. A large percentage of non-regular workers often leads to lower productivity and social inequality. In Korea’s case, women, youth, and older workers make up a large share of the non-regular tier. Regular tier workers, meanwhile, are more likely to be men with university degrees.To address the problems of the dual labor market, the government should shift the focus from jobs to workers. Korea already has universal health care that benefits all workers. This system should be protected and strengthened. The National Pension Scheme should be strengthened to benefit non-regular-tier workers.Among non-regular-tier workers, the self-employed are particularly important. As Korea has developed, the percentage of self-employed workers has gradually declined, but at 25.1 percent, it remains higher than any other developed country except Greece. Measures to increase profitability of self-employed workers are needed. Rent subsidies and tax relief will help increase profitability and strengthening self-employed pensions will help reduce inequality.Recovery from the COVID-19-induced economic difficulties will take time, but it also presents an opportunity to address structural problems, such as labor market duality, that are easy to overlook when times are good. Focusing on workers over jobs is a good place to start.Robert J. FouserRobert J.

At that time, Korea received bailout funds from the International Monetary Fund to escape the crisis.The start of the dialogue shows how severe economic stagnation and workforce reductions are.According to Statistics Korea, the number of employees on furlough in April was 1.48 million, up 1.13 million from the same month last year. The number in March was 1.6 million, up 1.26 million from a year earlier. The numbers and margins of increase were the highest since related data was first compiled in July 1983.Workers on furlough are statistically classified as being employed. If economic stagnation is prolonged, they will likely become jobless or economically inactive. The World Health Organization warns that we are in for a long fight against the coronavirus disease.According to the Korea Labor & Society Institute, the number of employed in April was 1.02 million fewer than in February. For comparison purposes, the 1998 currency crisis put 920,000 people out of work in the first two months.Economically vulnerable groups, including irregular workers at small and medium-sized companies, were the first to be hit. Now an employment cliff is imminent for regular staff members at large companies. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy and Finance Hong Nam-ki said the government will create more than 550,000 jobs in the public sector, but fiscally created jobs are unsustainable. It is urgent to create jobs in the private sector.The goal of the dialogue is to minimize the negative impact of the coronavirus on employment. An employment cliff is a difficult problem because of the different positions of labor and business. Labor groups demand a ban on layoffs and a tighter safety net for those who are out of work, while businesses call for limits on wage hikes and flexibility in the application of regulations on the maximum number of working hours.A day before the dialogue, the Federation of Korean Trade Unions held a press conference in front of the Korea Enterprises Federation, a lobby for employers, and called for large companies to spend their cash reserves to keep their workers employed. This kind of pressure does not help solve the problem.Employment is possible when companies exist. Now, business performance is plummeting. The operating and net profits of Kospi-listed companies fell 31 percent and 48 percent year-on-year, respectively, in the first quarter. Their second-quarter results are expected to be worse.A survey shows massive layoffs will be inevitable in one-third of large companies if the economic shock from COVID-19 is prolonged for more than six months. Labor groups must not think that businesses are exaggerating their hardships to solicit as many concessions as possible.Differences in the positions of labor, management and the government are inevitable. But if one side sticks to its guns and tries to put pressure on the other, they can never reach an agreement. Under the common goal of reviving the economy and protecting jobs, both labor and management need to consider a middle ground, such as shortening working hours and sharing jobs. Participants in the dialogue must try to understand one another and figure out what to give rather than what to get.When negotiations are stalled, the mediating role of the government will be more important. The government vowed to offer incentives to companies if they maintain employment, but it must not end up with symptomatic therapy. It should try to grasp what is truly needed to sustain employment. The government must also try to dispel concerns that it is inclined toward labor.Employment shock and business difficulties are already a reality. Dialogue must proceed as efficiently and quickly as possible. It has just begun and must be continued. Self-restraint and willingness to share pains are required."

This year, the coverage should be raised to at least 30 million,” Ki said, adding that the vaccines should be given free of charge to people with preexisting medical conditions, health care workers and other workers whose jobs involve a lot of person-to-person interactions.Ki also pointed out falling ill with both COVID-19 and the flu was “an unfortunate possibility.”An article that appeared in the Lancet medical journal on May 5 said co-infection by both viruses -- the coronavirus and the influenza -- though rare, was feasible.“Those vulnerable from COVID-19 are also at increased risk from flu, which is why increased efforts are necessary to deliver flu vaccination more extensively,” said infectious disease expert Dr. Lee Jacob of Seoul’s Hallym University Hospital.By Kim Arin (arin@heraldcorp.com)"

The student was among the 17 students who got tested before moving into a school dormitory Wednesday. The patient was asymptomatic, according to the Daegu’s education office. The dorm inhabitants were put in isolation and other third graders were ordered to return home. The third graders and all teachers and employees will be tested for the virus, according to health authorities.  Under the guidelines on response to COVID-19 infection at schools, schools that see a confirmed patient will be shut down for two days and turn to remote learning. Hosted by the Gyeonggi Provincial Office of Education, the mock exam is virtually the first opportunity for third-year high school students to see where they stand on a national scale and explore possible options for college applications. The previous mock test, organized last month by the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education, was held online as schools were physically shut amid spread of the coronavirus. The test results were not provided. Attended by some 77.6 percent of the country’s high schools, or 1,835 schools, the mock test covers five subjects from Korean language to mathematics, with the test results to be released starting June. 5. Students attending 66 schools in five districts in Incheon, where two high school third graders tested positive for the virus on the first day of school reopening Wednesday, sat the exam online, as schools were closed again. Incheon’s education office is to decide on whether to resume in-person classes Friday.Students at nine schools in Anseong, Gyeonggi Province, which reopened Thursday, took the exam as scheduled. The school postponed its reopening amid incomplete contact tracing for a patient confirmed to be infected Wednesday. About 450,000 high school seniors on Wednesday returned to classrooms nearly three months later than usual. The students, who had attended classes online, were the first group to go back to school, given a hectic academic calendar until they sit the college entrance exam scheduled for Dec. 3. Despite lingering safety concerns, health and education authorities are adamant that reopening of schools should continue, with daily quarantine practices in place. “About the reopening of schools for high school seniors, we cannot help but continue to see confirmed patients because the virus might be spreading quietly in communities. The thing is how fast we discover the patients, respond and calmly take action,” Kwon Jun-wook, deputy director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a briefing Thursday.

The department, contacted by Radio Free Asia on Wednesday about the COVID-19 situation in the North, said the country was still “vulnerable” and asked the radio station to refer to its earlier statement on the matter. “We strongly support and encourage the work of US and international aid and health organizations to counter and contain the spread of coronavirus in the DPRK,” the State Department said in February, referring to the North by its official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.At a World Health Assembly teleconference Monday and Tuesday, the North requested the loosening of UN sanctions, saying in a statement made public on the website of the World Health Organization that the sanctions hampered intergovernmental cooperation to curb COVID-19.Bruce Klingner, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation think tank, described Pyongyang’s statement as disingenuous. Sanctions against North Korea should be kept in place until it dismantles its nuclear arsenal, he told the radio station. Meanwhile, the US Agriculture Department forecasts that North Korea’s rice output this year will hit its lowest point in 26 years. The communist country is expected to reap an estimated 1.36 million tons this year, as compared with about 1.5 million tons in 1994.North Korea would have to import about 220,000 tons of rice this year to ride out the impact of the lower output, according to a recent report from the department’s Economic Research Service.“Sanctions and the ongoing pandemic slashed rice production in Pyongyang,” said Kim Kwan-ho, a senior researcher at the Korea Rural Community Corporation.

Two churches in Incheon, Palbock Church and Onlove Church, had a scare recently when a cluster of infections traced to Seoul’s Itaewon area affected two church members and led to around 780 people being tested for the virus. The churches followed social distancing guidelines and asked churchgoers to wear masks. “After the UCCK decided to announce Korean Church Worship Restoration Day, the COVID-19 spread that started from a gay club in Itaewon was very concerning, but the churches that were in danger of contamination stuck with prevention protocols so there would be no additional infections. The efforts of these churches gave us faith that everyone can return to their everyday lives,” said the UCCK in an announcement May 8.On Thursday the UCCK followed up its announcement, saying it had not meant to single out the LGBTQ community by using the term “gay club,” and told the participating churches to adjust the terms.“Of course, bringing back the church members doesn’t mean we will not have social distancing measures. We know the expected turnout will be less than 80 percent, but goals are meant to be something to head toward,” said the Rev. Kim Young-min of the UCCK. He also clarified that the goal was 80 percent of people who went to church before the spread of COVID-19, not 80 percent of all church members, saying the two numbers differed greatly.“The post-COVID-19 era will bring many changes. Korean churches entered a period of stagnation, but through the event on May 31, we plan to bring revival to faith and prepare for the coming times,” said Kim.On May 31, when Christians celebrate Pentecost, a feast that falls on the seventh Sunday after Easter and celebrates the descent of the Holy Spirit on the disciples, churches taking part in Korean Church Worship Restoration Day will arrange welcome events for their members.As numerous people are expected to head to church, the UCCK sent out guidelines requiring all participating churches to disinfect their premises constantly and to refrain from having small group meetings outside of Sunday services.  Many megachurches were already following most of the guidelines.“We follow all the necessary measures such as hand sanitization, going through heat scanners, wearing masks, among others,” said Park Myung-chul, a representative of the Yoido Full Gospel Church.“Each seat in the main chapel has a sticker already placed on it. The chapel can normally fit 12,000, but we only accepted 2,500 people who registered in advance,” said Park. “It’s uncomfortable, but it’s necessary. Around two-thirds of the people are still having services online,” he said.Another megachurch, the 6,500-seat Sarang Church, only took in 1,500 to 1,800 people. It considers May 31 the turning point in bringing its members back to church and is planning to take part in Korean Church Worship Restoration Day.Some churches have scheduled additional service times as a way of spreading out the crowds they expect.Kumnan Methodist Church made around one-third of its seats available for offline services on Sunday, but decided to offer one additional service to accommodate more people. Onnuri Church also added services, moving some of its Sunday services to Saturday in an attempt to limit the numbers at each service. Furthermore, no newcomers are allowed until further notice and members have to preregister online to receive the bar codes they need to enter the building.Churches said their members were still wary of offline services.A Grace and Truth Church official pointed out that of the 600 seats made available in its 2,500-seat chapel, only 400 or so were occupied as people are still nervous about COVID-19. Churchgoers must wear masks and disposable gloves at all times while in church.“Because of the Itaewon incident, we didn’t fill the 400 seats we’d prepared since many people seemed cautious still,” said the head of the administrative office for Somang Church, which also had fewer offline worshippers than expected.While some of its Sunday services were filled by elderly people, the Somang Church official said, only half the seats were filled at its young adult service.

The ideas appeared to remain sketchy, and we are just watching the developments at this point,"" he added.During Wednesday's teleconference organized by the Asia-Pacific Media Hub of the US State Department, Krach said that the EPN consists of like-minded countries, companies and civil societies that will operate under the same set of ""democratic values"" -- in an apparent reference to operating principles that China could balk at.Washington's push for the EPN appears to have picked up pace as the COVID-19 pandemic has offered a chastening reminder for the United States that has relied heavily on China-based supply chains for the production of such crucial items as face masks and ventilators.The initiative has also put many countries, particularly US allies and other partner countries, in a tricky diplomatic position amid concerns that it could lead to a challenging strategic choice between the two major powers.

The agency did not reveal the name of the latter.The company emphasized the “first time since 2016” factor, saying the endorsement deals were significant considering the advertisers were Chinese firms, not Korean or multinational brands. Experts are still wary, however, saying there are no immediate signs of improvement in Seoul-Beijing relations. “Despite the ban being a top-down order, there’s always been demand for Korean content in China. And as some time has passed and the relations are slowly improving amid the COVID-19 pandemic, it could be interpreted that Chinese companies are sending signals to their government,” said Lim Dae-geun, a professor of Chinese interpretation and translation at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul. “There are signs of optimism compared with four years ago when K-pop stars were removed from advertisements. But it’s too early to interpret it as anything more than what it actually is,” he added.Pop music critic Kim Yoon-ha echoes that sentiment. “Some are more optimistic, but if you look at it, it’s limited to YG artists. In G-Dragon’s case, he’s always been very popular in China, what with his presence on Weibo. And Lisa is a major celebrity and a beloved artist, more so in wider Asia than South Korea,” she said.“I don’t think it’s likely that we’ll see more K-pop acts enter the Chinese market soon following the news (about G-Dragon and Lisa). Because the impact of China’s K-pop ban was quite damaging on the industry, there is this atmosphere where people are trying to see the positive side.”With the void created by diplomatic friction with Asia’s pop culture powerhouse, Chinese TV viewers are seeing more artists from other countries -- such as Lisa from Thailand, who’s appeared as a mentor on survival audition show “Youth with You,” and Japanese R&B singer Misia, who recently appeared on singing competition show “Singer 2020.”“With South Korea forced out of the picture for now and the need for content from other countries, it seems that Southeast Asia and Japan are filing the gaps,” Lim said.By Yim Hyun-su (hyunsu@heraldcorp.com)"

Clark Equipment’s leveraging plan is adding a financial burden to Doosan Bobcat, as affiliates and subsidiaries of conglomerate Doosan Group‘s liquidity crunch might spill over to Doosan Bobcat that is already suffering a sharp fall in sales due to the ongoing coronavirus crisis, according to credit rating agencies Thursday.Moody’s Investor Service revised down the corporate credit outlook of Doosan Bobcat, which guaranteed the bonds, from “positive,” to “stable,” while affirming its “Ba3,” rating.“The change in Doosan Bobcat’s outlook to stable from positive reflects our expectation that its financial leverage over the next 12-18 months will increase because of softer earnings and an increase in debt, as well as increased group-related risks,” noted Moody’s Vice President and Senior Credit Officer Yoo Wan-hee.“That said, these risks are partly offset by Doosan Bobcat’s leadership position in its key markets, significant financial headroom as of the end of 2019, and good liquidity,” he added. Meanwhile, S&P Global Ratings maintained its negative outlook for its “BB” ratings.“We expect debt growth combined with weakening operating performance will narrow the buffer in our issuer credit rating on Doosan Bobcat,” noted Kim Min-jib, credit analyst at S&P Global.“The negative outlook on Doosan Bobcat reflects our view that the company’s overall credit profile will be under pressure for the next six to 12 months due to weaker earnings and liquidity pressure on the credit profile of its parent group, while the full effects of the COVID-19 pandemic remain highly uncertain,” Kim added.Doosan Bobcat guarantees a combined $1.2 billion worth of outstanding debt held by Clark Equipment.Both Moody’s and S&P Global said the parent group Doosan’s exacerbating debt condition is leaving Doosan Bobcat prone to higher liquidity risks. Doosan Bobcat is 51.05 percent owned by Doosan Infracore, machinery manufacturing unit of Doosan Group. The equipment maker is likely to be affected by the risk-averse stance in the domestic funding market that could disrupt Doosan Infracore’s refinancing effort, according to S&P Global.“Parent company Doosan Infracore’s relatively weak liquidity also pressures our issuer credit rating on Doosan Bobcat,” noted Kim. “Doosan Infracore’s heavy reliance on short-term debt (more than half of total debt) and ongoing refinancing needs expose the group to volatility in the funding market, which has become increasingly risk-averse.”Also, the financial trouble of Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction -- which owns 36.27 percent of Doosan Infracore -- could spill over to Doosan Bobcat, Moody’s noted. Facing heat from dwindling demand for fossil fuel power plants and nuclear power plants, Doosan Heavy is under a self-rescue plan that involves layoffs and sales of key affiliates, in exchange for a 2.4 trillion won ($1.9 billion) bailout loan from state-run lenders.“The ratings could also be strained if the credit quality of Doosan Bobcat’s immediate parent deteriorates meaningfully,” Yoo wrote. “While these developments are negative for Doosan Bobcat’s credit quality and expose the company to a certain degree of event risk, these risks are partly offset by Doosan Bobcat’s listed status and the policy banks’ liquidity support for Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction.” Doosan, a holding company of Doosan Group, recorded a 379.9 billion won net loss in the first quarter, a sharp turnaround from 54.9 billion won net profit a year prior, according to its consolidated financial statement.By Son Ji-hyoung (consnow@heraldcorp.com)"

The figure slipped 1.5 percent on-year. The Bank of Korea said that the index was weighed on by a tumble in oil prices, which dropped to historic lows in April. Scarce storage capacity coupled with an oversupply of oil due to COVID-19 led to the dramatic plunge last month. Though the prices have been still depressed this month, it has also been showing signs of recovery, West Texas Intermediate futures data recently showed. The price index for coal and petroleum products shed 22.6 percent on-month and 43.5 percent on-year.

Korea should enhance protection for local industries amid ‘global investment protectionism’: KIEP","Bae Hyunjung","http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200521000707&ACE_SEARCH=1","  While the global market dwindled and corporate assets depreciated amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the limited range and number of companies and assets with growth momentum have gained popularity from investors across borders.In order to keep the balance between economic revitalization and protection of “strategic business assets,” policymakers should raise the threshold for aspiring foreign investors here, according to a state-affiliated think tank.“The preliminary screening process for foreign investment has been fortified since 2018 for national security reasons,” the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy said Thursday in a report.“Now, under the influence of COVID-19, key economies around the globe have tensed up on the possibility that their competitive businesses may be acquired by foreign capital.”Reflecting the slowing economic momentum and escalating trade tension, global foreign direct investment has been on a decline over recent years, standing at $1.39 trillion in 2019, down 1 percent from a year earlier. Cross-border mergers and acquisitions have also dipped 40 percent on-year in 2019.Despite the concerns on the contracting market, however, key economies have underlined the need to heighten protection to secure strategic assets and technologies.“As in any crisis, when our industrial and corporate assets can be under stress, we need to protect our security and economic sovereignty,” Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said recently.Accordingly, the EU has tightened the screening rules for foreign investment in assets that are crucial to public order and infrastructure.France will be applying enhanced regulations upon foreign investment in the bio industry until the end of this year and ban foreign investors from acquiring stakes of 10 percent or more in designated core businesses.Italy has introduced a so-called golden power, which enables the central government to restrict or ban foreign capital according to needs.The United States in February kicked off its Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act to tighten the grip over foreign investors.Citing these overseas examples, KIEP advised Korean authorities to pay more attention to protective actions for local industries.“As important as it is to attract foreign capital for the sake of market revitalization, it is also crucial to establish legal measures to prevent the (excessive) outflow of core industries and technologies,” the report said.Also, as major economies have adopted investment protectionism, Korean companies that attempt M&A deals in the overseas market should exercise further caution concerning the FDI screening rules, it added.By Bae Hyun-jung (tellme@heraldcorp.com)"

Speaking at a press briefing, the minister said the goal is to close loopholes in the state-run job insurance program, which currently covers only half of the employed population.  “We will work with a will to pass a legislation that can provide employment insurance for worker in ‘special forms of employment,’” Lee said. Workers in “special forms of employment” include day laborers, self-employed people, courier service workers, golf caddies, door-to-door salespeople and similar workers who are currently not covered by employment insurance.The first group the ministry is eying is about 770,000 workers in nine occupations. Significant reform is needed in business operations and economic activity verification systems to later apply the program to freelancers and self-employed, the ministry said. According to government data, only 49.4 percent of the employed population in South Korea had employment insurance coverage in August last year.Since the universal payout of COVID-19 disaster relief funds stemming from financial difficulties of workers from contracted overall economy, the Moon Jae-in administration has been studying ways to expand the employment insurance scheme to all workers, including the self-employed. During the plenary session Wednesday, the National Assembly, led by the ruling Democratic Party, passed a revision to the Employment Insurance Act that includes artists as workers so they can receive employment insurance.“It is a new challenge in that we are applying employment insurance to artists, 70 percent of whom are freelancers,” Lee said. “We have now set up a base for employment insurance to be progressively applied to all working people, including freelancers.”While the National Assembly Environment and Labor Committee proposed earlier to include workers in special forms of employment in the revision, the opinion was not upheld in the bill passed Wednesday.During the press briefing, Lee also lauded that the parliament passed a bill on a package of employment support programs including provision of 500,000 won ($406) per month for up to six months to job seekers in the low-income bracket. The cash program applies to those that are not covered by employment insurance.“The government will do all its best to launch the program starting Jan. 1 next year,” Lee said, describing it as a new layer to employment safety net. This will increase people covered by the government’s unemployment benefits by 600,000 on top of 1.4 million covered by the above-mentioned employment insurance.By Ko Jun-tae (ko.juntae@heraldcorp.com)"

Kia Motors only managed to export 24,000 units in April, half of the 52,000 units in the same month last year.IHS Markit has predicted the size of the global automotive market to shrink by 22 percent on-year in 2020.Last month, 213 out of 300 global automotive production factories shut down over COVID-19 concerns. Major dealerships in countries like Germany, the UK, France, Mexico and India have been also hit hard lately. To overcome the current crisis, Kia Motors said it will establish an online sales platform in overseas markets and upgrade the quality of products for export. The automaker said it plans to come up with customized sales programs for customer groups in different countries, starting in Europe. Earlier this month, Kia Motors launched a campaign and offered to delay monthly installment payments by customers, home delivery service, online test-drive reservation and vehicle sanitization service. From the second half of this year, Kia Motors will also conduct a test-trial on a non-contact sales service via its online sales platform in Germany. The automaker already operates such online services in India and Russia, while the service will launch in China within the first half of this year.The automaker said it will also strengthen supply management and quality checks for models that are exported and manufactured at factories here. According to Kia Motors, over 60 percent of its annual production of 1.5 million units of vehicles are shipped abroad. To boost sales of its flagship models, the automaker said it will supply them timely, and also focus on promoting its Soul EV and Niro EV in Europe where the eco-friendly models are coveted.In the US, the automaker plans to debut the new versions of K5 and Sorento, as well as expand sales of its flagship model Telluride. By Kim Da-sol (ddd@heraldcorp.com)"

Samsung is expected to pour around 10 trillion won ($8.1 billion) for the Pyeongtaek EUV line, according to industry sources. It is part of Samsung’s 133 trillion won investment plan by 2030. The company completed the first EVU line, dubbed V1, in Hwaseong in the same province in February, and has been churning out chipsets used for mobile devices, high-performance computing and artificial intelligence on behalf of global customers like Intel, Qualcomm and Baidu. When President Moon Jae-in visited the construction site for the V1 line last year to announce the government’s vision for the system-on-chip industry, Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong had revealed the chipmaker’s plan to build another EUV line in Pyeongtaek. While the Hwaseong V1 line is currently dedicated to manufacturing customized chips on 7-nanometer and 6-nm processes, the new Pyeongtaek line will be used for 5-nm process and below. “The company will expand the volume of chips manufactured on sub-5-nm process in order to respond to the growing demand for EUV-based chips,” said Junng Eun-seung, president of Samsung’s foundry business. It is too early to estimate the volume expansion, but with full operations of the current V1 line, Samsung aims to boost EUV-based products by three times this year. The company also said it will continue hiring more engineers dedicated to the foundry business. Samsung is aggressively increasing investments in the foundry business in a bid to catch up with Taiwan’s TSMC. The announcement followed TSMC’s decision to construct a foundry factory in the United States. The Taiwanese company will be establishing a 5-nm process-based line in Arizona. Whether Samsung will expand its manufacturing facility in Austin in order to keep the rival under check remains to be seen. With the addition of the Pyeongtaek fab, Samsung will have a total of seven foundry production lines located in South Korea and the US, comprised of six 12-inch wafer lines and one 8-inch line.Regarding the possibility of increasing the Austin facility, Samsung declined to comment.According to TrendForce, Samsung’s share in the foundry market stood at 15.9 percent in the first quarter, due to declining demand triggered by the COVID-19 outbreak. TSMC maintained the top spot with a 54.1 percent share during the same period. By Song Su-hyun (song@heraldcorp.com)   "

Despite the slowing of new cases, symptomless or minimally symptomatic spread among the younger population remains a challenge for containment efforts, public health authorities said.Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Deputy Director Kwon Jun-wook said in a Thursday briefing that 10 out of 12 new cases were local cases, mostly linked to the early May outbreak in Itaewon, a nightlife district in Seoul. Of the 201 virus patients with ties to Itaewon, 95 were visitors of the nightclubs and 111 were their contacts, he said.“Virus transmission can occur in any settings where people gather and have contact,” the deputy director said, warning that “no one, not even young people, is immune from infection.”“Social distancing, maintaining personal hygiene and cough etiquette remain our best defense against the virus,” he said.Korea has tested 788,684 people so far to find that 11,122 were infected. Over 91 of the patients, or 10,135, have been released from care after recovering.One death linked to the virus was reported Thursday, with the fatality rate standing at 2.1 percent. The death toll now totals 264.Health Minister Park Neung-hoo said in a Central Disaster Management Headquarters meeting Thursday morning that the outbreak in Itaewon had “spread mainly through facilities where there had been a lack of safety precautions.”To prevent future lapses, “a more coherent infection surveillance system” will be established, he said.The minister stressed that because schools are back in session, students are strongly urged not to go to places where there is a high risk of infection, such as gaming cafes and any place where wearing face masks and keeping distance are not viable.In Incheon, where a series of fresh infections forced 66 high schools to suspend classes yet again, all karaoke bars are ordered to close from Thursday, health officials said. The measure comes after two high school seniors there were found on Wednesday to have contracted the virus after visiting karaoke lounges.“Given Incheon’s proximity to densely populated Seoul, delays in contact tracing can lead to large-scale transmissions,” said senior health official Yoon Tae-ho during a press briefing Thursday morning, urging people to get tested if they had been to places where infections had been detected.Since the first case in the Itaewon cluster was discovered May 6, at least 248 visitors to nightspots in the area remained unreachable, he said.Addressing the recent infections among health care workers at Samsung Medical Center in Seoul, the city’s health officials said they were testing over 1,400 people who may have been exposed. After a nurse tested positive on Monday, three more cases at the hospital have been confirmed.Meanwhile, in the past 24 hours, the world saw the largest single-day increase in new cases of 106,000, according to the World Health Organization, which said the global total was nearing 5 million.“We still have a long way to go in this pandemic,” said the chief of the United Nations agency, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in a Thursday media briefing.“But the good news is that it has been particularly impressive to see how countries like the Republic of Korea have built on their experience of MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) to quickly implement a comprehensive strategy to find, isolate and care for every case and trace every contact,” he said.This approach, he added, was critical to Korea “curtailing the first wave and now quickly identifying and containing new outbreaks.”By Kim Arin (arin@heraldcorp.com)"

The budget carrier has suspended all of its international flights since March 8 as countries strengthen entry restrictions on incoming passengers amid virus fears. Air Seoul, another budget carrier affiliate of Asiana Airlines, also plans to resume international flights in July as it expects eased entry restrictions in Asia.Jeju Air, South Korea's biggest budget carrier, currently flies on routes to Tokyo, Osaka, and Weihai, though there is only a small number of incoming passengers.  Still, officials from other budget carriers remain cautious about the resumption of international flights as it is uncertain whether the COVID-19 virus will slow down by June.Jin Air, a budget carrier affiliate of Korean Air Lines Co., said it has no plan to resume flights from July as it remains to be seen whether countries will ease or lift entry restrictions on incoming passengers. Eastar Jet, T'way Air Co. and Fly Gangwon have suspended all of their flights on international routes. On the full-service carrier front, Korean Air and Asiana have suspended more than 90 percent of their flights on long-haul routes since March. The country's two biggest carriers plan to resume flights on dozens of their international routes from June as they prepare for increased travel demand after countries ease entry restrictions. Korean Air is reopening 19 routes, which include those to Washington, DC, Seattle, Vancouver, Toronto, Frankfurt, Singapore, Beijing and Kuala Lumpur.

Of them, 10 were local infections.The country reported 32 COVID-19 cases Wednesday, marking the largest uptick in nine days, as it reeled from a steady rise in nightclub-related cases in Itaewon, a popular nightlife area in the capital.South Korea has successfully flattened the virus curve with massive and swift testing, but sporadic cluster infections continue to complicate public health authorities' quarantine efforts.Cases tied to clubs in Itaewon have not evolved into explosive infections but have continued to increase steadily. The number of virus cases linked to the Itaewon cluster reached 206 as of noon, with 10 new patients added over the past 24 hours.Itaewon emerged as a hotbed for infections after a 29-year-old man tested positive for COVID-19 on May 6 following visits to clubs in the district in early May.The country continued to report secondary and tertiary transmissions linked to the Itaewon outbreak.To stem further community spread, the city government in Incheon, west of Seoul, ordered some 2,400 karaoke facilities in the city not to host customers for two weeks, virtually suspending businesses at such places.Incheon reported 40 cases tied to Itaewon clubs as of noon, trailing 101 cases in Seoul and 45 in Gyeonggi Province that surrounds the capital.The government said it is considering implementing the same administrative order nationwide as more infections tied to karaoke facilities have been reported.""The Itaewon outbreak has not led to massive virus spread, but related infections have been reported consistently. That's why health authorities cannot loosen their guard against community spread,"" Yoon Tae-ho, a senior health official, said in a briefing.Health authorities are also on alert over looming infections at a hospital in southern Seoul.Since four nurses working at Samsung Medical Center, one of the country's five major general hospitals, were confirmed to be infected, health authorities have conducted tests on 1,418 people. No additional infections traced to the hospital were reported, but health authorities are conducting an epidemiological survey on two virus patients who came in contact with one of the infected nurses.The KCDC said more related cases are likely to spring up, as transmission routes are still unknown.It said Wednesday the nurses may have been infected at shared spaces, such as changing rooms, in the hospital or through patients undergoing surgery.The agency said it has yet to find a link between their cases and those tied to nightclubs.Health authorities remain on alert over further community spread, as more schools are set to reopen after high school seniors began to return to schools Wednesday.Incheon, west of Seoul, and Anseong, south of the capital, ordered third graders at 75 high schools to return home on Wednesday. Two high school students tested positive for COVID-19 in Incheon in cases related to the Itaewon cluster.Earlier in the day, a high school in the southeastern city of Daegu, once the epicenter of the virus outbreak here, was closed as a third grader who used a school dormitory was infected.Seoul's southwestern Yangcheon Ward is considering delaying the reopening of at least three elementary schools set for May 27 due to a church-related case in the district.The country, meanwhile, added two imported cases and reported one additional death, raising the total death toll to 264. The fatality rate was 2.37 percent.The total number of people released from quarantine after full recoveries stood at 10,135, up 69 from the previous day.Since Jan. 3, the country, with a population of more than 50 million, has carried out 788,684 tests, including 12,251 the previous day.
